## CRITICAL: CODE SAFETY RULES

### **🔴 NEVER USE F-STRINGS WITH HTML CONTENT**
❌ **FORBIDDEN:**
```python
html = f"<div class='{css_class}'>{content}</div>"
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```python
html = '<div class="' + css_class + '">' + content + '</div>'
# OR
html = '<div class="{}">{}</div>'.format(css_class, content)
```

### **🔴 MANDATORY FILE GENERATION PATTERN:**
```python
# Step 1: Define HTML structure with triple quotes
html_template = '''<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Comprehensive Analysis Report</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-50">
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">Report Title</h1>
        <!-- Content sections -->
    </div>
    <script>
        // Chart implementations
    </script>
</body>
</html>'''

# Step 2: Insert dynamic content safely
html_content = html_template.replace('<!-- Content sections -->', report_sections)
```
