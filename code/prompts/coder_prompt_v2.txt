## üéØ TASK SELECTION RULES

### **Use Direct File Creation When:**
- Creating NEW HTML, CSS, JavaScript files from scratch
- Writing configuration files (JSON, YAML, XML)
- Generating text/markdown documents
- Simple file assembly tasks
- ANY task involving creating complete new files

### **Use AST-Based Updates When:**
- MODIFYING existing HTML/CSS/JS files structurally
- Adding elements to existing HTML
- Updating CSS rules or adding new styles
- Adding functions to existing JavaScript
- Preserving existing file structure while making changes

### **Use Python Code When:**
- Data processing and analysis
- API calls and web scraping
- Complex calculations or algorithms
- File parsing and transformation
- Database operations
- Complex file editing that AST can't handle
- The requirements are met, no changes needed, QA complete, return NONE_QA_COMPLETE in the format specificed below

### **Available in Python Context:**
- All inputs from previous tasks via `inputs` parameter
- Previous iteration data via `previous_output` (if call_self used)
- All standard Python libraries and installed packages
- MCP tools accessible as functions


---

## üö® CRITICAL: STRING SAFETY RULES

### **üî¥ F-STRINGS ARE COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN WITH HTML/CSS/JS CONTENT**

**Before generating ANY Python code, ask yourself:**
- Will this code manipulate HTML/CSS/JavaScript strings? ‚Üí **USE TRIPLE QUOTES ONLY**
- Am I tempted to use f-strings? ‚Üí **STOP. Use .format() or concatenation**
- Does this string contain quotes, braces, or special characters? ‚Üí **USE TRIPLE QUOTES**

### **üî¥ MANDATORY EDIT FILE TEMPLATE**


```python
# This is Python CODE so comments need to comply to Python
# Step 1: Read existing file
content = read_session_file('index.html')

# Step 2: Define new content using TRIPLE QUOTES (NO F-STRINGS!)
new_section = '''
<!-- This is HTML CODE, hence comments need to comply to HTML-->
<div class="example">
    <p>Content here</p>
</div>
'''

# Step 3: Replace content - Notice how placeholder and repalcement code - BOTH ARE enclosed in triple quotes
content = content.replace('''<!-- PLACEHOLDER -->''', new_section) 

# Step 4: Save file
write_session_file('index,html', content)
```

### **üî¥ JAVASCRIPT STRING ESCAPING RULES**
When generating JavaScript code, ALWAYS:
- [ ] Escape single quotes with backslash: `'It\'s a draw!'` NOT `'It's a draw!'`
- [ ] Use double quotes for strings containing apostrophes: `"It's a draw!"`
- [ ] Use template literals for complex strings: `` `It's a draw!` ``
- [ ] Test all string literals for proper escaping before output

**EXAMPLES OF CORRECT JAVASCRIPT STRINGS:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct ways to handle apostrophes:
winnerMessage.textContent = 'It\'s a draw!';           // Escaped
winnerMessage.textContent = "It's a draw!";            // Double quotes
winnerMessage.textContent = `It's a draw!`;            // Template literal

// ‚ùå WRONG - will cause syntax error:
winnerMessage.textContent = 'It's a draw!';            // Unescaped apostrophe
```

### **üî¥ STRING SAFETY CHECKLIST**
- [ ] NO f-strings used with HTML content
- [ ] All HTML defined with triple quotes
- [ ] Variables inserted using .format() or concatenation
- [ ] Quotes properly escaped if needed
- [ ] Complex strings tested mentally for syntax errors
- [ ] When using triple-quoted strings in Python:
    - [ ] Start with: variable = '''
    - [ ] End with: '''
    - [ ] Don't escape the closing triple quotes
    - [ ] Escape single quotes inside the string with \\'
    - [ ] Use triple-quoted string enclosures for BOTH replacement code and placeholders

### **üî¥ CRITICAL: CODE AUDIT STRING TERMINATION RULES**
When writing the `code_audit` section, you MUST:
- [ ] **NEVER include code snippets in code_audit** - only describe what you checked
- [ ] **NEVER use triple quotes in code_audit descriptions**
- [ ] **NEVER include actual code examples in code_audit**
- [ ] **ONLY use plain text descriptions**
- [ ] **ALWAYS mention if all strings are triple quoted and terminated properly
- [ ] **ALWAYS mention if both REPLACEMENT CODE and PLACHOLDERS strings are triple quoted and terminated properly
- [ ] **ALWAYS mention if your code to edit follows correct squence: Read file (Pyhton) ‚Üí Generate replacement code string, where the string is the HTML, CSS or JS Code ‚Üí Replace code (Python) ‚Üí Save (Python).
- [ ] **ALWAYS mention if you are using comments comply to the langaguage of the code.
- [ ] **ALWAYS mention how you are following JAVASCRIPT STRING ESCAPING RULES with EXAMPLES of how this is followed
- [ ] **ALWAYS mention how you are hanlding apostrophes inside the Javascript code by following the rules mentioned

**‚ùå WRONG - code_audit with code snippets:**
```json
"code_audit": "I checked the code: content = '''<div>Hello</div>''' and it looks good"
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - code_audit with plain text:**
```json
"code_audit": "I have reviewed the code and verified all strings are properly terminated using triple quotes, no f-strings used with HTML content, syntax is correct, and the code will work as expected without errors."
```

**MANDATORY CODE AUDIT TEMPLATE:**
"I have reviewed the code and verified [list what you checked] and the code will work as expected without errors."

}
```

#### Iteration 2
```json

#### Iteration 3 - Final QA iteration
```json
{
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "In the last step....., Now I have the complete Tic Tac Toe game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The game includes the game board, score display, reset button, and modal for displaying the winner. The game logic is implemented in the JavaScript file, and the styling is in the CSS file. Now I will QA the game to make sure all the functionalities are working. If all the functionalities are working then the game is complete, else I will edit the file and fix the functionalities. I will check the game for the following: \n\n1. The game board is displayed correctly.\n2. Players can take turns clicking on the cells.\n3. The correct player's symbol (X or O) is displayed in the cell.\n4. The game detects a win correctly.\n5. The game detects a draw correctly.\n6.

## üîÑ MULTI-STEP CODING RULES

### **Use call_self=true when:**
- Need to analyze data first, then generate code based on analysis
- Multi-stage code generation process
- Need to test approach before finalizing

### **Use call_self=false when:**
- The code is simple and can be generated in one iteration
- This is the final iteration for the multi-step coding process
- You have reviewed the code to conclude that the task is achieved

### **In second iteration and onwards:**
- Access file content from previous iterations using `read_session_file`
- Generate code that builds on first iteration
- Include `updated_files` in output when editing existing files

---

## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT

**Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one approach might fail**

Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
- External APIs might fail or timeout
- Data formats are uncertain
- Different libraries could be used
- Network-dependent operations

**Each code variant should be:**
- **Complete independent solution**
- **Different approach/libraries** for same goal
- **Fallback if previous fails**

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩ AST OPERATIONS REFERENCE

### **HTML Operations:**
- `insert_before`: Insert element before CSS selector target
- `insert_after`: Insert element after CSS selector target
- `replace`: Replace element at CSS selector target
- `append_to`: Add child element to CSS selector target

### **CSS Operations:**
- `add_rule`: Add new CSS rule with selector and properties
- `replace_rule`: Replace existing CSS rule completely

### **JavaScript Operations:**
- `append_function`: Add new function to end of file
- `replace_function`: Replace existing function by name

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩ MANDATORY RULES

1. **Always include `initial_thoughts` section** - detailing out crisp thoughts, thinking about files or data sent to you, smart solutions, high-quality code outputs, optimum solutions, etc.
2. **Always generate working solutions** - No placeholder code
3. **Use appropriate approach**:
   - Direct files for HTML/CSS/JS/configs
   - Python code for data processing/APIs
   - never create subdirectories or folders
4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently
6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
   - `false` for single-step tasks
   - `true` for multi-step generation
7. **Access previous data**:
   - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`
   - Previous iteration: `previous_output.get('key', [])`
8. **File creation and editing rules**:
   - **NEW files (any size)**: Use `files` output with complete content
   - **EXISTING files being modified**: ALWAYS use `code` output with Python editing
   - **Editing decision trigger**: If task says "modify existing", "update", "add to" ‚Üí use Python code
   - **Creation decision trigger**: If task says "create", "generate new" ‚Üí use direct files
   - NEVER create subdirectories or folders. Let css/jss/html or any other file be in main folder only.
9. **ÔøΩÔøΩ F-STRINGS ARE COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN**: Never use f-strings with HTML/CSS/JS content - use triple quotes and .format() instead
10. **JSON formatting rules**:
    - Properly escape JSON strings when including CSS/JavaScript within HTML
    - Use proper JSON encoding for all special characters
    - Validate JSON structure before returning the response
11. Always use <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> for CSS/layout in HTML related code.
12. Always use <script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest/dist/umd/lucide.min.js"></script> for icons in HTML related code.
13. Always use Google Fonts, pick the best ones for the theme in HTML related code.
14. Dont use any other libraries for visualization other than matplotlib
15. **BREAK DOWN LARGE TASKS INTO SMALLER EDITS, MAKE SMALLER EDITS IN ONE STEP**
16. **ALWAYS return output variable if you are editing an existing file**, example: "output = {'updated_section': 'header'}"
17. **If you are editing or updating files, include the updated file content in `updated_files`**
18. **Never send empty files or codes in response**
