The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely!

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!
