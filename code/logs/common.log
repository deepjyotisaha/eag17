  # PlannerAgent v4 Prompt ‚Äì Executive‚ÄëGrade Task Graph Generator ($100K Consulting/CodingStudio Style)
  # Role  : Strategic Planner  
  # Output: plan_graph + next_step_id
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **PlannerAgent v4**, the executive planning module of an agentic system using NetworkX graph architecture.
  Your job is to convert a user's complex goal into a **multi-agent execution plan** where agents pass their outputs directly to subsequent agents in a simple chain.
  You do not execute.
  You do not generate code or content.
  You **only plan** ‚Äî as if leading a high-stakes consulting/coding-program engagement with a $100,000 budget.
  ## üö® CRITICAL: META-PLANNING FIRST - NEVER ASSUME UNKNOWN DATA
  **‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE creating any detailed plan, ask yourself:**
  - **Do I know the actual content/structure of referenced files?** 
  - **Do I know the specific business model/environment mentioned?**
  - **Do I know the technical setup/infrastructure details?**
  **If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí CREATE DISCOVERY PLAN FIRST**
  ### üéØ MANDATORY META-PLANNING TRIGGERS
  **CREATE SHORT DISCOVERY PLAN when:**
  - **Query references files** but you don't know their actual content/structure 
  - **Business strategy requests** require researching existing models/competitors
  - **Technical tasks** need environmental discovery (infrastructure, dependencies)
  - **Market analysis** requires competitive/industry research
  **‚ùå NEVER ASSUME:**
  - File contents, schemas, or structures
  - Business models of mentioned companies  
  - Technical environments or infrastructure
  - Market conditions or competitive landscapes
  ### **Meta-Planning Pattern:**
  T001-T009: Discovery tasks (DistillerAgent, RetrieverAgent, ThinkerAgent)
  T010+: PlannerAgent reads discovery outputs ‚Üí Creates comprehensive plan
  ### **Discovery Examples**
  **Problem 1: "Analyze these financial files and create insights"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown file structure, sheets, columns, data types
  **Discovery Plan**: 
  - T001: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze actual file structure, sheets, columns, data types, sample rows"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Based on T001 output, create detailed data analysis plan"
  **Problem 2: "Create a business strategy like Myntra but for health drinks"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Need Myntra's actual model + health drinks market data  
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research Myntra's actual business model, revenue streams, operations"
  - T002: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research health drinks market, competitors, distribution"  
  - T003: ThinkerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze adaptation opportunities from Myntra to health drinks"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create comprehensive health drinks strategy based on T001, T002, T003 outputs"
  **Problem 3: "Deploy this application to production"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown infrastructure, dependencies, deployment requirements
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: CoderAgent ‚Üí "Scan actual infrastructure, dependencies, configuration files"
  - T002: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze application requirements, environment variables"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create deployment strategy based on T001, T002 outputs"
  ## üß† PHILOSOPHY ‚Äì THINK LIKE A CONSULTING OR ADVANCED CODING/DEVELOPMENT FIRM
  You are simulating a **5‚Äì10 person consulting/development/coding team**, each owning a discrete, researchable, delegate-ready task. Your plan should reflect:
  * **High granularity**: Each task is something a senior analyst or senior architect could complete and report independently
  * **Structured layers**: Phase-based grouping across Research ‚Üí Extraction ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Output
  * **Delivery rigor**: Your final output (the graph) should be deliverable to a C-suite executive with confidence
  * **Team modularity**: Think of how team members would divide and conquer the goal logically
  ## ‚úÖ MODES
  ### "initial" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`: The user's overall goal
  * `planning_strategy`: "conservative" or "exploratory"
  * `file_manifest`: Metadata list of any uploaded files
  You must:
  * **First check for meta-planning triggers** (unknown files, business models, technical environments)
  * Output your thoughts in `initial_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me think through this..."
  * Output your initial plan in `initial_plan`, always starting with "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges..."
  * Output your validation checklist in `validation_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me briefly go through my validation checklist..."
  * Output a full `plan_graph` with:
    * `nodes`: Discrete, agent-assigned task objects (ID, description, prompt, dependencies)
    * `edges`: Directed edges representing execution flow
  * Set the first `next_step_id`
  ### "mid_session" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`, `planning_strategy`, `file_manifest`
  * Prior `plan_graph`, plus `completed_steps` and `failed_steps`
  You must:
  * Update only what's logically affected by failures or new context
  * Reuse step IDs where task logic remains intact
  * Add fallback nodes or reassign agents if needed
  ## ‚úÖ NODE FORMAT - SIMPLE OUTPUT CHAIN
  Each task (`node`) must include:
  {
    "id": "T003",
    "description": "...",
    "agent": "RetrieverAgent" | "ThinkerAgent" | "DistillerAgent" | "CoderAgent" | "FormatterAgent" | "QAAgent" | "ClarificationAgent" | "SchedulerAgent" | "PlannerAgent",
    "agent_prompt": "...",
    "reads": ["T001", "T002"],
    "writes": ["T003"]
  }
  **SIMPLE DATA FLOW:**
  * `reads`: Array of previous task IDs whose outputs this task needs
  * `writes`: Just the current task ID (for dependency tracking)
  * **Agents receive**: Previous task outputs directly in their `inputs` parameter
  * **Agents output**: Results in their `output` field
  * **Code generation**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field with variants
  **Example Flow:**
  T001 RetrieverAgent ‚Üí output: {analysis: "...", data: [...]}
  T002 ThinkerAgent ‚Üí receives T001.output ‚Üí output: {insights: "...", recommendations: [...]}  
  T003 CoderAgent ‚Üí receives T002.output ‚Üí output: {report: "..."}, code: {"CODE_1": "...", "CODE_2": "..."}
  ## ‚úÖ PLANNING STYLE
  ### üîÅ 1. Unroll All Entity-Level Tasks
  If the query references multiple **entities** (e.g., companies, tools, formats, people), create one task per entity per required action.
  ### üìä 2. Use Entity √ó Dimension Matrix Unrolling
  When research spans **multiple entities and multiple dimensions**, create a **task per (entity √ó dimension)**.
  ### üìÖ 3. Time-Indexed or Scope-Indexed Expansion
  For timeline, schedule, or flow-based projects:
  * Break tasks **per unit** of time (e.g., day, hour, phase)
  * Or **per location/segment** (e.g., per city, per category)
  ### üß† 4. Use Role-Based Abstraction
  Simulate layered planning like a real team:
  * **RetrieverAgent**: Gathers raw external or document-based info
  * **ThinkerAgent**: Clusters, compares, or resolves logic
  * **DistillerAgent**: Reads and synthesizes description, summaries or bullets for ANY file (including images, OCR PDF, programming files, etc.). Call DistillerAgent as the LAST node ONLY if it was a coding assignment, and a report is not required.
  * **CoderAgent**: Thinks, writes, and automatically executes required code in a single atomic step.  
    - Supports multiple languages and formats: Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bash, DSL, SVG, spreadsheet formulas, deployment commands, and file packaging.  
    - Capable of handling **multi-step, multi-file logic** ‚Äî e.g., writing interlinked Python modules, or editing multiple HTML/CSS/JS files.  
    - **Code execution happens automatically** after generation.  
    - All generated code stored in `code` object field with fallback variants.  
    - Execution outputs automatically saved in `output` field.  
    - CoderAgent can call itself if work is incomplete.
    - If you plan to call CoderAgent multiple times to edit same file, **make sure to ask it to leave placeholders in the first call to update in the future calls**. Else future updates may end up overwriting same file.
    - Never call CoderAgent for final summaries, reports, or HTML outputs. Always call FormatterAgent.
    - You may not need to call CoderAgent multiple times as it can generate upto 30000 word code at once! It has STRONG CONTEXT and can generate LONG CODE at once, specially for HTML/JS/CSS.
  * **FormatterAgent**: Beautifies final outputs into human-readable formats such as Markdown, HTML, tables, or annotated text. If a user wants final report, handbook, or plan in HTML, always call FormatterAgent.
    - **Pass as much upstream content as possible** from previous task outputs.  
    - FormatterAgent can **merge multiple inputs** and display them as a cohesive presentation.  
    - Output should be rich, well-structured, and visually organized.
    - Call `FormatterAgent` if user wants a report, lot of research was done, or result formatting is required.
    - **CANNOT INTEGRATE MULTIPLE FILES, LIKE HTML/CSS/JS**. Call **CoderAgent** for such tasks.
  * **QAAgent**: Reviews and critiques final or interim products.  
  * **ClarificationAgent**: Queries human or confirms ambiguous steps
  * **SchedulerAgent**: Defines time-aware or trigger-bound execution
  * **PlannerAgent**: Creates execution plans and can call itself for meta-planning when insufficient context exists for comprehensive planning.
  * **ReportGeneratorAgent**: Generates an exhaustive well-formatted HTML report with charts, tables etc.
  !!ATTENTION!!: All our Agents are STATELESS. Which means they do not have memeory of previous steps. You will have to manually send old files/data/information and output of past Agents. 
  For instance, if you ask CoderAgent for one task, and then ask it to improve upon the last task, you MUST send previous CoderAgent's call's output.
  ### ü™ú 5. Use Phased Execution Layers
  Organize work into structured layers:
  1. **Discovery & Raw Retrieval**
  2. **Entity √ó Dimension Mapping**
  3. **Per-Dimension Synthesis**
  4. **Comparative Meta-Analysis**
  5. **Output Structuring & Formatting**
  6. **Validation & Compliance**
  7. **Final Presentation Prep**
  ## üîç COMPARISON & GAP FILLING
  If multiple similar entities are studied, include:
  * **Cross-comparison steps** to highlight differences
  * **Coverage analysis** (e.g., "which segments are underserved?")
  * **Fallback tasks** if essential data is missing
  ## üó£ HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
  Use `ClarificationAgent` to:
  * Ask the human for clarification or preference
  * Share partial results for feedback before proceeding
  * Trigger confirmation before committing long-running paths
  ## üïí TIME-AWARE EXECUTION
  Use `SchedulerAgent` to define:
  * Future-triggered actions
  * Periodic or daily reruns
  * Time-sensitive coordination tasks
  ## ‚úÖ EXECUTION STYLE REQUIREMENTS
  * Simulate a real-world consulting/coding/development project where each task is worth assigning to a dedicated contributor
  * **Simple Dependencies**: Use task IDs in `reads` field - no complex variable tracking
  * **Direct Output Passing**: Agents receive previous outputs in `inputs` parameter
  * **Code Variants**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field as fallback variants
  * Insert corrective loops if essential data is likely to be missing
  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT RULES
  * Do NOT compress multiple deliverables into one step (except for CoderAgent)
  * Prefer consolidated deliverables for CoderAgent
  * Do NOT assign multiple agents to a task
  * Do NOT output placeholders or markdown
  * DO ensure each `agent_prompt` can run immediately with no improvisation
  * **NEVER create separate CoderAgent steps for generation vs execution** ‚Äî CoderAgent always generates AND executes in one atomic step
  * **META-PLANNING ID SEQUENCE**: When using discovery pattern, use T010+ for final PlannerAgent nodes to avoid conflicts with discovery phase (T001-T009)
  * **USE META-PLANNING when**: Query lacks essential context. Create short discovery plan ‚Üí final PlannerAgent node.
  * **NEVER ASSUME FILE CONTENTS**: If query references files but you don't know their actual structure/content, always create discovery plan first
  * **NEVER CALL FORMATTERAGENT IF TASK WAS TO PURELY CODE SOMETHING**: Call DistillerAgent to summarize the job.
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this: <Your thoughts, constraints that must be remembered for the Agents you're going to call, comments on placeholders, and thoughts on how state data must be passed on to Agents>.",
    "initial_plan": "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges: <Your initial graph on which you will run your validation thoughts to perfect the graph>"
    "validation_thoughts": "Let me briefly go through my validation list..."
    "plan_graph": {
      "nodes": [...],
      "edges": [...]
    },
    "next_step_id": "T001"
  }
  Each node must be executable, unique, and atomic.
  **Edge format**: Use `{"source": "ROOT", "target": "T001"}` structure.
  **Validation Checklist Before Outputting:**
  - [ ] Did I check for meta-planning triggers?
  - [ ] All other agents are "state-less". Have I given each agent, like CoderAgent context about what other CoderAgents would be working on?
  - [ ] Have I provided all required inputs to all agent, especially CoderAgents?
  - [ ] Have I provided all output file names to coderAgent? What if all coderAgents create files with same names and overwrite them? 
  - [ ] The plan that I will generate will run in Parallel if all dependencies are completed. Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed?
  - [ ] Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments?
  - [ ] Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs?
  - [ ] Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality?
  - [ ] Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it? It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? 
  - [ ] Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc.
  - [ ] For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages? Will that not make CoderAgents to work in isolation, each creating its own file/theme/font/css! I should first make a CoderAgent to focus on theme, design, structure, and then send its outputs as inputs to all coderAgents. 
  - [ ] Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task! That's forbidden!!!!
  Your job is to **plan at the level of world-class consulting/programming/development quality** ‚Äî granular, logically phased, modular, and fully delegable.
  If your plan lacks clarity, redundancy control, or structural thoroughness ‚Äî we will lose a $100,000+ contract and future engagements.
  So keep your **ULTRA THINK** mode ON while planning.
  Return only the `plan_graph` and `next_step_id` as JSON.

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data on related or unrelated topics, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"

      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('India Japan flights direct routes DEL NRT airfare', 6)\noutput = {'flights': results}"
    }

    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"

  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
  Before outputting:
  - [ ] Used real tool names (search_web_with_text_content, convert_pdf_to_markdown, etc.)
  - [ ] Code format is object with CODE_1, CODE_2 keys
  - [ ] Each code variant is complete and independent
  - [ ] Used search_web_with_text_content as primary tool
  - [ ] Only provided fallbacks when genuinely needed
  - [ ] Code ends with `output = {...}`
  - [ ] Use call_self=true when asked for comprehensive research or details
  - [ ] Previous output variables are accessed as per available structure
  - [ ] Final step is returning consolidated output across all iterations in a multi-step process
  **Your role**: Call tools ‚Üí Retrieve raw data ‚Üí Pass to next agent.
  Return only valid JSON with no markdown formatting.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India.

Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India.

Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data on related or unrelated topics, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**

  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

  - [ ] Use call_self=true when asked for comprehensive research or details
  - [ ] Previous output variables are accessed as per available structure
  - [ ] Final step is returning consolidated output across all iterations in a multi-step process
  **Your role**: Call tools ‚Üí Retrieve raw data ‚Üí Pass to next agent.
  Return only valid JSON with no markdown formatting.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT.

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT.

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data on related or unrelated topics, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES

    }
    "code_audit": "I have reviewed the code... <if you have checked for string termination, logical consistency, syntax errors etc. include any details needed to make sure your code works as expected, is error free and is of high quality>"

  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you

It helps manufactures from designing and investing in safety features, this in turn makes roads safer and reduces fatalities in an accident. Let's find out how was the Mahindra XUV 3XO performing in the Bharat NCAP crash test? An Indian automaker has scored a full 5-star safety rating for its vehicle in the Bharat NCAP crash test with the Mahindra XUV 3XO getting a full 5-star safety rating. In adult as well as child occupant protection categories, this compact SUV rendered exemplary performance. The AOP assessment of the XUV 3XO scored an excellent 29.36 points out of a possible 32. This high score is a result of the vehicle's strong structure and well designed safety systems that help keep adult occupants safe in most crash scenarios. Additionally, the XUV 3XO did very well for child occupant protection (COP), illustrating the commitment to protect younger passengers.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India.

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India.

These ratings are given after comprehensive testing by independent organisations that assess various aspects of vehicle safety. These include structural integrity, airbag effectiveness, and safety assist technologies. The aim is to help potential buyers make an informed decision about a cars ability to safeguard its passengers. Here are the main organisations that provide safety ratings: Global NCAP : This globally respected body conducts crash tests and rates vehicles on a scale from one to five stars based on their performance in various crash scenarios. Euro NCAP : Known for its detailed evaluations, this organisation focuses on adult and child protection, pedestrian safety, and safety assist technologies. Bharat NCAP : Indias official safety programme , which ensures that vehicles sold in the country meet national safety standards. These organisations help car buyers by providing objective safety information that can guide their decision-making process.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag!

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17.

The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India.

Financing options, such as the new car loan from Bajaj Finance, provide the flexibility needed to make car ownership more manageable.

Safety ratings are critical indicators of how well a vehicle can protect its occupants during a crash. These ratings are given after comprehensive testing by independent organisations that assess various aspects of vehicle safety. These include structural integrity, airbag effectiveness, and safety assist technologies. The aim is to help potential buyers make an informed decision about a cars ability to safeguard its passengers. Here are the main organisations that provide safety ratings: Global NCAP : This globally respected body conducts crash tests and rates vehicles on a scale from one to five stars based on their performance in various crash scenarios. Euro NCAP : Known for its detailed evaluations, this organisation focuses on adult and child protection, pedestrian safety, and safety assist technologies. Bharat NCAP : Indias official safety programme , which ensures that vehicles sold in the country meet national safety standards. These organisations help car buyers by providing objective safety information that can guide their decision-making process. When it comes to the Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating, it has received excellent scores from these testing bodies, making it one of the top contenders for buyers who prioritise safety. All about Mahindra XUV 3XO safety ratings The Mahindra XUV 3XO has made a significant impact in the market, particularly for its safety credentials. The vehicle received a five-star safety rating in the Bharat NCAP crash tests, making it one of the safest options in its category.

The XUV 3XO inherits the solid safety foundation of its predecessor, the XUV300, which also received a five-star rating in the Global NCAP tests.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag!

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection.

The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift.

Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India.

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 .

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection.

On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag!

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700.

Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India.

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection.

On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag!

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700.

Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India.

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection.

On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag!

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700.

Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness.

By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.
