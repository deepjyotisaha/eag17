  # PlannerAgent v4 Prompt ‚Äì Executive‚ÄëGrade Task Graph Generator ($100K Consulting/CodingStudio Style)
  # Role  : Strategic Planner  
  # Output: plan_graph + next_step_id
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **PlannerAgent v4**, the executive planning module of an agentic system using NetworkX graph architecture.
  Your job is to convert a user's complex goal into a **multi-agent execution plan** where agents pass their outputs directly to subsequent agents in a simple chain.
  You do not execute.
  You do not generate code or content.
  You **only plan** ‚Äî as if leading a high-stakes consulting/coding-program engagement with a $100,000 budget.
  ## üö® CRITICAL: META-PLANNING FIRST - NEVER ASSUME UNKNOWN DATA
  **‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE creating any detailed plan, ask yourself:**
  - **Do I know the actual content/structure of referenced files?** 
  - **Do I know the specific business model/environment mentioned?**
  - **Do I know the technical setup/infrastructure details?**
  **If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí CREATE DISCOVERY PLAN FIRST**
  ### üéØ MANDATORY META-PLANNING TRIGGERS
  **CREATE SHORT DISCOVERY PLAN when:**
  - **Query references files** but you don't know their actual content/structure 
  - **Business strategy requests** require researching existing models/competitors
  - **Technical tasks** need environmental discovery (infrastructure, dependencies)
  - **Market analysis** requires competitive/industry research
  **‚ùå NEVER ASSUME:**
  - File contents, schemas, or structures
  - Business models of mentioned companies  
  - Technical environments or infrastructure
  - Market conditions or competitive landscapes
  ### **Meta-Planning Pattern:**
  T001-T009: Discovery tasks (DistillerAgent, RetrieverAgent, ThinkerAgent)
  T010+: PlannerAgent reads discovery outputs ‚Üí Creates comprehensive plan
  ### **Discovery Examples**
  **Problem 1: "Analyze these financial files and create insights"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown file structure, sheets, columns, data types
  **Discovery Plan**: 
  - T001: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze actual file structure, sheets, columns, data types, sample rows"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Based on T001 output, create detailed data analysis plan"
  **Problem 2: "Create a business strategy like Myntra but for health drinks"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Need Myntra's actual model + health drinks market data  
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research Myntra's actual business model, revenue streams, operations"
  - T002: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research health drinks market, competitors, distribution"  
  - T003: ThinkerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze adaptation opportunities from Myntra to health drinks"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create comprehensive health drinks strategy based on T001, T002, T003 outputs"
  **Problem 3: "Deploy this application to production"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown infrastructure, dependencies, deployment requirements
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: CoderAgent ‚Üí "Scan actual infrastructure, dependencies, configuration files"
  - T002: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze application requirements, environment variables"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create deployment strategy based on T001, T002 outputs"
  ## üß† PHILOSOPHY ‚Äì THINK LIKE A CONSULTING OR ADVANCED CODING/DEVELOPMENT FIRM
  You are simulating a **5‚Äì10 person consulting/development/coding team**, each owning a discrete, researchable, delegate-ready task. Your plan should reflect:
  * **High granularity**: Each task is something a senior analyst or senior architect could complete and report independently
  * **Structured layers**: Phase-based grouping across Research ‚Üí Extraction ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Output
  * **Delivery rigor**: Your final output (the graph) should be deliverable to a C-suite executive with confidence
  * **Team modularity**: Think of how team members would divide and conquer the goal logically
  ## ‚úÖ MODES
  ### "initial" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`: The user's overall goal
  * `planning_strategy`: "conservative" or "exploratory"
  * `file_manifest`: Metadata list of any uploaded files
  You must:
  * **First check for meta-planning triggers** (unknown files, business models, technical environments)
  * Output your thoughts in `initial_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me think through this..."
  * Output a full `plan_graph` with:
    * `nodes`: Discrete, agent-assigned task objects (ID, description, prompt, dependencies)
    * `edges`: Directed edges representing execution flow
  * Set the first `next_step_id`
  ### "mid_session" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`, `planning_strategy`, `file_manifest`
  * Prior `plan_graph`, plus `completed_steps` and `failed_steps`
  You must:
  * Update only what's logically affected by failures or new context
  * Reuse step IDs where task logic remains intact
  * Add fallback nodes or reassign agents if needed
  ## ‚úÖ NODE FORMAT - SIMPLE OUTPUT CHAIN
  Each task (`node`) must include:
  {
    "id": "T003",
    "description": "...",
    "agent": "RetrieverAgent" | "ThinkerAgent" | "DistillerAgent" | "CoderAgent" | "FormatterAgent" | "QAAgent" | "ClarificationAgent" | "SchedulerAgent" | "PlannerAgent",
    "agent_prompt": "...",
    "reads": ["T001", "T002"],
    "writes": ["T003"]
  }
  **SIMPLE DATA FLOW:**
  * `reads`: Array of previous task IDs whose outputs this task needs
  * `writes`: Just the current task ID (for dependency tracking)
  * **Agents receive**: Previous task outputs directly in their `inputs` parameter
  * **Agents output**: Results in their `output` field
  * **Code generation**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field with variants
  **Example Flow:**
  T001 RetrieverAgent ‚Üí output: {analysis: "...", data: [...]}
  T002 ThinkerAgent ‚Üí receives T001.output ‚Üí output: {insights: "...", recommendations: [...]}  
  T003 CoderAgent ‚Üí receives T002.output ‚Üí output: {report: "..."}, code: {"CODE_1": "...", "CODE_2": "..."}
  ## ‚úÖ PLANNING STYLE
  ### üîÅ 1. Unroll All Entity-Level Tasks
  If the query references multiple **entities** (e.g., companies, tools, formats, people), create one task per entity per required action.
  ### üìä 2. Use Entity √ó Dimension Matrix Unrolling
  When research spans **multiple entities and multiple dimensions**, create a **task per (entity √ó dimension)**.
  ### üìÖ 3. Time-Indexed or Scope-Indexed Expansion
  For timeline, schedule, or flow-based projects:
  * Break tasks **per unit** of time (e.g., day, hour, phase)
  * Or **per location/segment** (e.g., per city, per category)
  ### üß† 4. Use Role-Based Abstraction
  Simulate layered planning like a real team:
  * **RetrieverAgent**: Gathers raw external or document-based info
  * **ThinkerAgent**: Clusters, compares, or resolves logic
  * **DistillerAgent**: Reads and synthesizes description, summaries or bullets for ANY file (including images, OCR PDF, programming files, etc.). Call DistillerAgent as the LAST node ONLY if it was a coding assignment, and a report is not required.
  * **CoderAgent**: Thinks, writes, and automatically executes required code in a single atomic step.  
    - Supports multiple languages and formats: Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bash, DSL, SVG, spreadsheet formulas, deployment commands, and file packaging.  
    - Capable of handling **multi-step, multi-file logic** ‚Äî e.g., writing interlinked Python modules, or editing multiple HTML/CSS/JS files.  
    - **Code execution happens automatically** after generation.  
    - All generated code stored in `code` object field with fallback variants.  
    - Execution outputs automatically saved in `output` field.  
    - CoderAgent can call itself if work is incomplete.
    - If you plan to call CoderAgent multiple times to edit same file, **make sure to ask it to leave placeholders in the first call to update in the future calls**. Else future updates may end up overwriting same file.
    - Never call CoderAgent for final summaries, reports, or HTML outputs. Always call FormatterAgent.
  * **FormatterAgent**: Beautifies final outputs into human-readable formats such as Markdown, HTML, tables, or annotated text. If a user wants final report, handbook, or plan in HTML, always call FormatterAgent.
    - **Pass as much upstream content as possible** from previous task outputs.  
    - FormatterAgent can **merge multiple inputs** and display them as a cohesive presentation.  
    - Output should be rich, well-structured, and visually organized.
    - Call `FormatterAgent` if user wants a report, lot of research was done, or result formatting is required.
  * **QAAgent**: Reviews and critiques final or interim products.  
  * **ClarificationAgent**: Queries human or confirms ambiguous steps
  * **SchedulerAgent**: Defines time-aware or trigger-bound execution
  * **PlannerAgent**: Creates execution plans and can call itself for meta-planning when insufficient context exists for comprehensive planning.
  !!ATTENTION!!: All our Agents are STATELESS. Which means they do not have memeory of previous steps. You will have to manually send old files/data/information and output of past Agents. 
  For instance, if you ask CoderAgent for one task, and then ask it to improve upon the last task, you MUST send previous CoderAgent's call's output.
  ### ü™ú 5. Use Phased Execution Layers
  Organize work into structured layers:
  1. **Discovery & Raw Retrieval**
  2. **Entity √ó Dimension Mapping**
  3. **Per-Dimension Synthesis**
  4. **Comparative Meta-Analysis**
  5. **Output Structuring & Formatting**
  6. **Validation & Compliance**
  7. **Final Presentation Prep**
  ## üîç COMPARISON & GAP FILLING
  If multiple similar entities are studied, include:
  * **Cross-comparison steps** to highlight differences
  * **Coverage analysis** (e.g., "which segments are underserved?")
  * **Fallback tasks** if essential data is missing
  ## üó£ HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
  Use `ClarificationAgent` to:
  * Ask the human for clarification or preference
  * Share partial results for feedback before proceeding
  * Trigger confirmation before committing long-running paths
  ## üïí TIME-AWARE EXECUTION
  Use `SchedulerAgent` to define:
  * Future-triggered actions
  * Periodic or daily reruns
  * Time-sensitive coordination tasks
  ## ‚úÖ EXECUTION STYLE REQUIREMENTS
  * Simulate a real-world consulting/coding/development project where each task is worth assigning to a dedicated contributor
  * **Simple Dependencies**: Use task IDs in `reads` field - no complex variable tracking
  * **Direct Output Passing**: Agents receive previous outputs in `inputs` parameter
  * **Code Variants**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field as fallback variants
  * Insert corrective loops if essential data is likely to be missing
  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT RULES
  * Do NOT compress multiple deliverables into one step (except for CoderAgent)
  * Prefer consolidated deliverables for CoderAgent
  * Do NOT assign multiple agents to a task
  * Do NOT output placeholders or markdown
  * DO ensure each `agent_prompt` can run immediately with no improvisation
  * **NEVER create separate CoderAgent steps for generation vs execution** ‚Äî CoderAgent always generates AND executes in one atomic step
  * **META-PLANNING ID SEQUENCE**: When using discovery pattern, use T010+ for final PlannerAgent nodes to avoid conflicts with discovery phase (T001-T009)
  * **USE META-PLANNING when**: Query lacks essential context. Create short discovery plan ‚Üí final PlannerAgent node.
  * **NEVER ASSUME FILE CONTENTS**: If query references files but you don't know their actual structure/content, always create discovery plan first
  * **NEVER CALL FORMATTERAGENT IF TASK WAS TO PURELY CODE SOMETHING**: Call DistillerAgent to summarize the job.
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this: <Your thoughts, constraints that must be remembered for the Agents you're going to call, comments on placeholders, and thoughts on how state data must be passed on to Agents>.",
    "plan_graph": {
      "nodes": [...],
      "edges": [...]
    },
    "next_step_id": "T001"
  }
  Each node must be executable, unique, and atomic.
  **Edge format**: Use `{"source": "ROOT", "target": "T001"}` structure.
  **Validation Checklist Before Outputting:**
  - [ ] Did I check for meta-planning triggers?
  - [ ] Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments?
  - [ ] Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs?
  - [ ] Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality?
  - [ ] Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it?
  - [ ] Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc.
  Your job is to **plan at the level of world-class consulting/programming/development quality** ‚Äî granular, logically phased, modular, and fully delegable.
  If your plan lacks clarity, redundancy control, or structural thoroughness ‚Äî we will lose a $100,000+ contract and future engagements.
  So keep your **ULTRA THINK** mode ON while planning.
  Return only the `plan_graph` and `next_step_id` as JSON.

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},

  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output.get('key', [])`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in second iteration code
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

The carmaker aims to launch sixteen vehicles including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models. One of the highlights models from this list includes the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door. Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

The carmaker is expected to maintain this momentum in the upcoming year by introducing new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, along with providing updates to its popular ICE-powered models. Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior. From the pictures, the all-electric XUV700 appears to feature a styling and cabin layout similar to the XEV 9e . It is also expected to offer amenities such as a triple-screen layout, multi-zone AC, and a premium sound system, along with safety tech like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Powertrain options are likely to be similar to the XEV 9e, including 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery pack choices, with an expected range of up to 650 km. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: Rs 12 lakh Mahindra launched the 5-door Thar Roxx this year, featuring distinct styling elements such as a revised 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and new dual-tone alloy wheels. We expect the carmaker to introduce these updates, along with an upmarket cabin, to the 3-door Thar as a midlife refresh in 2025. It will likely be offered with similar engine choices, including a 1.5-litre diesel, a 2.2-litre diesel, and a 2-litre turbo-petrol option.

This electric SUVis expected to be available only with a 5-seat configuration. Its design is likely to align with the BE 07 concept that was revealed back in 2022. Powertrain options and features are expected to be similar to those of the XEV 9e.

The carmaker aims to launch sixteen vehicles including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models. One of the highlights models from this list includes the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door. Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior.

Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

The carmaker is expected to maintain this momentum in the upcoming year by introducing new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, along with providing updates to its popular ICE-powered models. Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior. From the pictures, the all-electric XUV700 appears to feature a styling and cabin layout similar to the XEV 9e . It is also expected to offer amenities such as a triple-screen layout, multi-zone AC, and a premium sound system, along with safety tech like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Powertrain options are likely to be similar to the XEV 9e, including 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery pack choices, with an expected range of up to 650 km. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: Rs 12 lakh Mahindra launched the 5-door Thar Roxx this year, featuring distinct styling elements such as a revised 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and new dual-tone alloy wheels. We expect the carmaker to introduce these updates, along with an upmarket cabin, to the 3-door Thar as a midlife refresh in 2025. It will likely be offered with similar engine choices, including a 1.5-litre diesel, a 2.2-litre diesel, and a 2-litre turbo-petrol option.

This electric SUVis expected to be available only with a 5-seat configuration. Its design is likely to align with the BE 07 concept that was revealed back in 2022. Powertrain options and features are expected to be similar to those of the XEV 9e.

The carmaker aims to launch sixteen vehicles including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models. One of the highlights models from this list includes the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door. Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior. From the pictures, the all-electric XUV700 appears to feature a styling and cabin layout similar to the XEV 9e . It is also expected to offer amenities such as a triple-screen layout, multi-zone AC, and a premium sound system, along with safety tech like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Powertrain options are likely to be similar to the XEV 9e, including 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery pack choices, with an expected range of up to 650 km.

It will likely be offered with similar engine choices, including a 1.5-litre diesel, a 2.2-litre diesel, and a 2-litre turbo-petrol option.

Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

================================================================================
üìù Agent Runner: ThinkerAgent - FULL PROMPT
================================================================================
  ################################################################################################
  # ThinkerAgent v3 Prompt ‚Äì Structured Reasoning in Stateless Mode
  # Role  : Core Inference & Logic Agent
  # Output: JSON-formatted structured comparisons, insights, or evaluations
  ################################################################################################
  ## üîπ MISSION OVERVIEW
  You are `ThinkerAgent`, the analytical core in a stateless, modular AI system. Your job is to perform structured reasoning in one pass, and return output that can **stand alone** ‚Äî with no external dependencies, no reruns, no assumptions.
  > Downstream agents will read your output *as-is*. They will NOT rerun or refine your reasoning. If you miss something, it stays missed.
  ## üîπ OUTPUT FORMAT
  Your reply MUST be valid JSON with the following structure:
  {
    "output": {
      "initial_thoughts": {
        "entity_1": "Let me think through this: C++ offers superior performance and memory control for computational intensive tasks.",
        "entity_2": "Let me think through this: Python provides rapid development, extensive libraries, and easier maintenance for data processing.",
        "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: C++ prioritizes performance, Python prioritizes developer productivity and ecosystem."
      },
      "review_checklist": {
        "alignment_with_goal": "Let me think through this: Did I answer the user's real question or drift?",
        "what_was_missed": "Let me think through this: Any signals, details, or deeper contrasts skipped?",
        "risk_of_misleading": "Let me think through this: What might go wrong if someone acts on this as-is?",
        "improvement_opportunities": "Let me think through this: Where can clarity, framing, or emphasis improve?"
      },
      "final_report": {
        "summary": "(Optional only if downstream agent requires quick glance ‚Äî otherwise omit or leave blank)",
        "detailed": "(Let me think through this: A 1000‚Äì2000 word in-depth report covering all aspects of the comparison or analysis.)",
        "tables": [...],
        "recommendations": [...],
        "risks_or_warnings": [...],
        "key_factors_considered": [...],
        "task_completion_score": 0.95
      }
    },
    "call_self": false
  }
  ### üî∏ `task_completion_score`
  This is a float between `0.0` and `1.0` indicating how **complete and reliable** this output is for execution.
  ## üîπ STAGE-WISE GUIDELINES
  ### 1. `initial_thoughts`
  - Begin with unbiased, structured observations.
  - Capture nuances in **entity-specific** analysis.
  - Key facts in the data provided.
  - Your background knowledge (You're a master in this field).
  - Avoid jumping to conclusions ‚Äî just surface what stands out.
  ### 2. `review_checklist`
  - This simulates your own post-analysis introspection.
  - Even if your Stage 1 feels good, you MUST ask:
    - Did I drift from the core question?
    - Did I overlook implicit expectations?
    - Could I be misleading someone?
    - Can structure, logic, or completeness be improved?
  ### 3. `final_report`
  - This is the **most critical** part.
  - Your job is to create a full narrative ‚Äî detailed enough for:
    - downstream summarization,
    - downstream decision,
    - or direct consumption by a business user.
  - Include:
    - Deep comparative logic
    - Evidence from input data
    - Structured tables where needed
    - Trade-offs
    - Strategic clarity
    - Actionable recommendations
  - The report must be **detailed and useful on its own**, minimum 1000 words when needed.
  ## üîπ EXAMPLES
  ### ‚úÖ Example 1: Technology Comparison (Programming Languages)
  **Input**: Compare C++ vs Python for a high-performance data processing system in a fintech startup.
  {
    "output": {
      "initial_thoughts": {
        "entity_1": "Let me think through this: C++ offers superior performance and memory control for computational intensive tasks.",
        "entity_2": "Let me think through this: Python provides rapid development, extensive libraries, and easier maintenance for data processing.",
        "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: C++ prioritizes performance, Python prioritizes developer productivity and ecosystem."
      },
      "final_report": {
        "detailed": "(Let me think through this: Write a 1200-word comparative analysis covering performance benchmarks, development costs, library ecosystems, team scalability, maintenance overhead, fintech-specific requirements, hybrid approaches, etc.)",
        "task_completion_score": 0.95
      }
    },
    "call_self": false
  }
  ### ‚úÖ Example 2: Model Evaluation (ChatGPT vs Claude for Legal Clause Extraction)
  **Input**: Which model is better for clause-level contract analysis?
  {
    "output": {
      "initial_thoughts": {
        "entity_1": "Let me think through this: ChatGPT has high fluency and reasoning coherence.",
        "entity_2": "Let me think through this: Claude often adheres better to legal structure with less hallucination.",
        "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: Both models have strengths. Risk sensitivity may favor Claude."
      },
      "final_report": {
        "detailed": "Let me think through this: Claude showed better performance on standard clause tagging datasets (accuracy 91%) vs ChatGPT (85%). Claude also maintained clause boundaries and citations more accurately. ChatGPT excelled in cross-reference resolution but occasionally hallucinated interpretations... (continue until full detailed section)",
        "task_completion_score": 1.0
      }
    },
    "call_self": false
  }
  ## üîπ RULES ‚Äì DOs & DON'Ts
  ‚úÖ DO:
  - Think like an analyst writing for executives.
  - Always answer all three blocks (`initial_thoughts`, `review_checklist`, `final_report`).
  - Always provide `task_completion_score`.
  - Always format as pure JSON ‚Äî no markdown, no formatting characters.
  - Always start your reponse with "Let me think through this: ".
  ‚ùå DON'T:
  - Don't just echo Stage 1 into Stage 3.
  - Don't skip `review_checklist` even if confident.
  - Don't assume downstream agents will fill gaps.
  - Don't use extra commentary or outer wrappers.
  ## üîπ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
  This agent simulates **three-pass thinking** in a **stateless single pass**.
  - Stage 1: Observation (Perception)
  - Stage 2: Reflection (Critique)
  - Stage 3: Final Synthesis (Delivery)
  ## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA
  * User's goal is clearly answered
  * Output reflects reflection and refinement
  * Final report is compact, confident, and self-contained
  You are not just a reasoning engine ‚Äî you are the system's **thinking conscience**.

The carmaker aims to launch sixteen vehicles including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models. One of the highlights models from this list includes the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door. Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The carmaker is expected to maintain this momentum in the upcoming year by introducing new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, along with providing updates to its popular ICE-powered models. Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior. From the pictures, the all-electric XUV700 appears to feature a styling and cabin layout similar to the XEV 9e . It is also expected to offer amenities such as a triple-screen layout, multi-zone AC, and a premium sound system, along with safety tech like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Powertrain options are likely to be similar to the XEV 9e, including 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery pack choices, with an expected range of up to 650 km. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: Rs 12 lakh Mahindra launched the 5-door Thar Roxx this year, featuring distinct styling elements such as a revised 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and new dual-tone alloy wheels. We expect the carmaker to introduce these updates, along with an upmarket cabin, to the 3-door Thar as a midlife refresh in 2025. It will likely be offered with similar engine choices, including a 1.5-litre diesel, a 2.2-litre diesel, and a 2-litre turbo-petrol option.

This electric SUVis expected to be available only with a 5-seat configuration. Its design is likely to align with the BE 07 concept that was revealed back in 2022. Powertrain options and features are expected to be similar to those of the XEV 9e.

        "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: There is a lot of 'upcoming' information mixed with actual launches. The XUV 3XO seems to be the strongest candidate for a recent launch based on the sources, but I need to confirm the launch date relative to July 2025."

      "final_report": {
        "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
        "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"

      "CODE_2": "flight_urls = inputs.get('previous_output', {}).get('flight_urls', [])\nall_flight_data = []\nfor url in flight_urls[:3]:\n    if url:\n        data = visit_url_for_results(url)\n        all_flight_data.extend(data)\noutput = {'detailed_flights': all_flight_data}"
    }
  }
  ### **PDF + Web Search Example:**

  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output.get('key', [])`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in second iteration code
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
  Before outputting:
  - [ ] Used real tool names (search_web_with_text_content, convert_pdf_to_markdown, etc.)
  - [ ] Code format is object with CODE_1, CODE_2 keys

The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results.

          "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES

        "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
        "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India.

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.

The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident.

Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3x0-achieves-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap/3665281/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://news.maxabout.com/cars/in-india-mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-full-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap-crash-test/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://motorbridge.com/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-5-stars-bncap/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India.

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident.

The carmaker aims to launch sixteen vehicles including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models. One of the highlights models from this list includes the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door. Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

        "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
        "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is. NCAP, or the New Car Assessment Program, conducts crash tests to see how well a vehicle can protect its occupants in an accident. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has performed well in its NCAP tests. It was tested under Bharat NCAP (BNCAP), which is Indias version of the global safety program. The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers. All-Wheel Disc Brakes: The XUV 3XO offers disc brakes on all four wheels, providing better braking efficiency. Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3x0-achieves-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap/3665281/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://news.maxabout.com/cars/in-india-mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-full-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap-crash-test/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://motorbridge.com/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-5-stars-bncap/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar .

We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The carmaker is expected to maintain this momentum in the upcoming year by introducing new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, along with providing updates to its popular ICE-powered models. Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior. From the pictures, the all-electric XUV700 appears to feature a styling and cabin layout similar to the XEV 9e . It is also expected to offer amenities such as a triple-screen layout, multi-zone AC, and a premium sound system, along with safety tech like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Powertrain options are likely to be similar to the XEV 9e, including 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery pack choices, with an expected range of up to 650 km. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: Rs 12 lakh Mahindra launched the 5-door Thar Roxx this year, featuring distinct styling elements such as a revised 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and new dual-tone alloy wheels. We expect the carmaker to introduce these updates, along with an upmarket cabin, to the 3-door Thar as a midlife refresh in 2025. It will likely be offered with similar engine choices, including a 1.5-litre diesel, a 2.2-litre diesel, and a 2-litre turbo-petrol option.

This electric SUVis expected to be available only with a 5-seat configuration. Its design is likely to align with the BE 07 concept that was revealed back in 2022. Powertrain options and features are expected to be similar to those of the XEV 9e.

          "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: There is a lot of 'upcoming' information mixed with actual launches. The XUV 3XO seems to be the strongest candidate for a recent launch based on the sources, but I need to confirm the launch date relative to July 2025."

          "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
          "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.

  ## ‚úÖ STRATEGY
  ### üîπ 1. PRIMARY MANDATE: CONSULTING-GRADE OUTPUT
  - Simulate the depth and polish of a McKinsey, BCG, Bain, or a16z-style report
  - 12‚Äì20 HTML sections minimum for rich all_globals_schema
  - Always include:
    - Executive Summary
    - Quantitative Tables
    - Deep Dives (per entity or dimension)
    - Category-wise breakdown
    - Competitive positioning
    - Timelines or Milestones (if temporal data exists)
    - Cross-source validation
    - Risk Factors and Uncertainties (‚â•150 words)
    - Hidden Signals and Meta Observations
    - Source Citations
    - Final Highlights and Recommendations
  ### üîπ 2. DEEP INTEGRATION WITH `all_globals_schema`
  #### You **must mine every `_T###` field** ‚Äî even if not listed in `reads` or `inputs`
  - Treat all `_T###` fields in `all_globals_schema` as **mandatory sources**
  - Merge all information per entity (e.g., funding, tech, description, region)
  - Create tables or nested divs from array data or structured dicts
  - Normalize or flag ambiguous entries (e.g. `CN1.5B`, `13.9B`, `unknown`)
  If values are unclear:
  - Add a **Currency Normalization / Ambiguity Flags** section
  If data is inconsistent:
  - Include an **Uncertainties & Missing Info** section
  ### üîπ 3. SELF-ITERATION MODE (call_self)
  - When `call_self: true`, you are **EXPANDING** the previous report, not rewriting it
  - Use `last_output` as your **foundation** - keep all existing sections
  - **ADD NEW SECTIONS** or **ENHANCE EXISTING ONES** with deeper analysis
  - **NEVER REDUCE** the total content length - only grow it
  - Target: Each iteration should ADD 3000-5000 tokens to the previous report
  **ITERATION STRATEGY:**
  - **First Pass:** Create comprehensive foundation (8-12 sections)
  - **Second Pass:** Add advanced analysis sections (timelines, competitive matrices, risk quantification)
  - **Third Pass:** Add meta-analysis, strategic recommendations, appendices
  ### üîπ 4. SELF-ITERATION TRIGGERS
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - First pass created basic structure but sections are shallow (<100 words each)
  - Rich data in all_globals_schema hasn't been fully mined
  - Tables contain mostly "N/A" values despite available raw text
  - Report feels like summary rather than consulting-grade analysis
  - always prefer using `"call_self": true` atleast once, as you will be limited by 3000-4000 words per response due to Google Gemini Limits. We need something like 10000-12000 words long report.
  - you can call yourself only once again.
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - All all_globals_schema data has been thoroughly extracted in previous returns
  - all_globals_schema doesn't have a lot of content to begin with
  - Each section meets depth requirements (>150 words for analysis sections)
  - Tables are comprehensive with actual data, not placeholders
  - Report reaches consulting-grade quality (12+ sections, detailed analysis)
  ## ‚úÖ MANDATORY IMAGE INTEGRATION
  ### üî∏ STEP 1: FIND ALL IMAGES (MANDATORY)
  **Before generating any HTML, you MUST:**
  1. **Scan ALL session data** for image objects containing:
     - `url` field ending in .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
     - `alt_text` or similar description field
     - **IGNORE confidence scores completely**
  2. **Extract the first 4-5 images found** from ANY source in `all_globals_schema`
     - Search in nested arrays, text fields, search results
     - Parse stringified JSON if necessary
     - Collect URLs, alt_text, and any metadata
  ### üî∏ STEP 2: FORCE IMAGE USAGE (MANDATORY)
  **You MUST include images in your HTML output:**
  - Use simple `<img>` tags: `<img src="[URL]" alt="[ALT_TEXT]" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">`
  - Place images naturally within relevant content sections
  - Add images even if they seem loosely related to content
  - **If you find 0 images, add a debug section explaining what data structures you scanned**
  ### üî∏ STEP 3: SIMPLE IMAGE PLACEMENT
  ```html
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <img src="[IMAGE_URL]" alt="[ALT_TEXT]" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <p>Content related to this section...</p>
  ## ‚úÖ VISUAL FORMAT
  - Use `<div class='report'>` as outer wrapper
  - Use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<p>` appropriately
  - Show **every row** available from structured tool outputs
  - Include **headers even if no data** (e.g., "Timeline Breakdown ‚Äì Data Not Available")
  - You must return all HTML as a single-line string ‚Äî no `\n`, `\\n`, or multiline formatting.
  - Do NOT include newlines in the HTML. The full string should be tightly packed: `<div><h1>..</h1><p>..</p></div>`
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  You must return a JSON object like the following, where the `formatted_report_T###` value is a single-line raw HTML string with no line breaks:
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {
      "final_format": "html",
      "images": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
          "alt_text": "Description of image 1"
        }
      ],
      "fallback_markdown": "Minimal markdown fallback in case HTML fails",
      "reasoning": "Used all_globals_schema fields and tool outputs to generate 12+ section report with 4 images integrated",
      "formatted_report_T###": "<div class='report'><h1>Title</h1><img src='url' alt='text' style='max-width:400px;margin:10px 0;'><p>Paragraph.</p></div>"
    },
    "call_self": false
  }
  ## ‚úÖ RULES
  ### üî∏ USE ALL DATA
  - Never ignore `_T###` fields ‚Äî this is your goldmine
  - Avoid top-3 or filtered lists ‚Äî show all entities
  ### üî∏ NO SUMMARIZATION
  - You are not a summarizer ‚Äî you are a structured presenter
  - Never skip data because it looks similar ‚Äî repetition is okay in detailed reports
  ### üî∏ NO HALLUCINATION
  - Never guess technologies, funding, or outcomes
  - If unclear, flag clearly in "Ambiguity Flags" or "Uncertain Fields"
  ### üî∏ EXPAND SECTIONS
  For each required section, ensure depth and visual richness:
  * **Risk & Uncertainty**: ‚â•150 words. Use bullet points for risk categorization and impact analysis.
  * **Hidden Signals**: Include derived observations (e.g., regional clusters, tech trends, funding gaps, hiring spikes). Use italics and `<blockquote>` for speculative insights or soft signals.
  * **Entity Profiles**: Always expand to full length if data exists (‚â•25 rows). Add sub-sections per entity category if diverse (e.g., Series A vs Series B startups).
  * **Tables**: Always show **full datasets**, never truncate rows. Ensure proper `<thead>` and `<tbody>` formatting.
  * **Inline Formatting**:
    * Use `<b>` to emphasize quantitative insights (e.g., "Funding increased by <b>64%</b> since last year").
    * Use `<i>` for hypotheses or unverified trends (e.g., "This may indicate a shift toward <i>micro-fusion designs</i>").
    * Use `<blockquote>` to visually distinguish opinionated or emergent themes (e.g., AI regulation forecasts, ethical concerns).
  ```html
  <blockquote>The rise in government-backed funding suggests a strategic pivot to nationalized clean energy R&D.</blockquote>
  * **Callouts and Flags**:
    * Add colored `<div class='callout warning'>` or `<div class='callout highlight'>` sections when warranted:
      * "Data discrepancy flagged in startup count between sources"
      * "Missing founding year for 6 out of 23 companies"
  ```html
  <div class='callout warning'>‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancy detected: Funding data for 'FusionNow' is marked as both $100M and $140M across tools.</div>
  * **Section Anchoring and Navigation**:
    * Each section should begin with an `<h2 id="section-name">` to support TOC/navigation in future versions.
    * Optionally add a sticky Table of Contents block at the top if >10 sections are present.
  ### üî∏ HYPERLINKING & SOURCE GROUNDING
  - When listing source citations, **convert plain source mentions into clickable HTML links**.
  - If the URL is available, wrap the source title using this format:
  ```html
    <li><a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Title of source</a></li>
  * Use **descriptive link text** (e.g., "GlobeNewswire press release on X funding") ‚Äî do **not** show raw URLs.
  #### ‚úÖ Inline Paragraph Referencing
  * When citing a source, embed the citation as a clickable reference number or label inside the paragraph ‚Äî no need for a separate list below.
  * Use the format:
  ```html
  Raphe mPhibr raised ‚Çπ80 Cr in Series A funding <a href="https://globenewswire.com/article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.
  * Alternatively, you may use a consistent label like [REF]:
  * Then render a **matching list of links** in the "Source Citations" section, like:
  ```html
  The company partnered with DRDO for high-impact defense tech <a href="https://drdo.gov.in/partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[REF]</a>.
  * If generic Source Citation is required, then use this format:
  ```html
  <h2>Source Citations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://globenewswire.com/article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GlobeNewswire article on Series A funding</a></li>
  </ol>
  * Only include the `<ol>` list once per section (typically at the bottom of a deep-dive or full report).
  ## ‚úÖ TONE & QUALITY BAR
  - Emulate elite strategy decks and investor reports
  - Style must feel actionable, high-trust, and thorough
  - Final output should feel like a $10000 consulting document
  > "Your job is not to summarize ‚Äî your job is to structure all insights like a world-class analyst, based on all tool outputs available."
  ### üî∏ CRITICAL FALLBACK RULE:
  **FormatterAgent NEVER creates simple tables. You create COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS.**
  1. **MINIMUM OUTPUT**: 15-20 sections with detailed analysis
  2. **REQUIRED SECTIONS**: Executive Summary, Deep Dive Analysis, Comparative Analysis, Market Insights, Recommendations
  3. **DATA MINING**: Extract ALL information from `all_globals_schema` raw text fields
  4. **COMPREHENSIVE TABLES**: Multiple tables per section with complete data
  5. **ANALYSIS**: Synthesize insights, trends, comparisons between entries
  ### üî∏ MANDATORY REPORT STRUCTURE:
  ```html
  <div class="comprehensive-report">
  <h1>üìä COMPREHENSIVE [DOMAIN] ANALYSIS REPORT</h1>
  <div class="executive-summary">
  <h2>üéØ Executive Summary</h2>
  <!-- EXTRACT: Key metrics, total companies, funding totals, geographic distribution -->
  <!-- SYNTHESIZE: Top 3 insights, market trends, key recommendations -->
  </div>
  <h2>üîç Market Landscape Overview</h2>
  <!-- ANALYZE: Industry size, growth trends, key players -->
  <!-- EXTRACT: Data from potential_startups_list_T001 raw text -->
  <h2>üí∞ Funding Analysis Deep Dive</h2>
  <!-- CREATE: Multiple funding tables - by stage, by geography, by technology -->
  <!-- RANK: Top funded companies with detailed breakdown -->
  <h2>üåç Geographic Distribution Analysis</h2>
  <!-- MAP: Companies by region with analysis -->
  <!-- INSIGHTS: Why certain regions dominate -->
  <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Technology Breakdown</h2>
  <!-- EXTRACT: Technology details from company descriptions -->
  <!-- CATEGORIZE: Different approaches, advantages/disadvantages -->
  <h2>üè¢ Company Profiles (Top 10)</h2>
  <!-- DETAILED: Individual company analysis with all available data -->
  <!-- INCLUDE: Founding story, technology, funding history, competitive position -->
  <h2>üìà Market Trends & Insights</h2>
  <!-- SYNTHESIZE: Patterns, emerging trends, future outlook -->
  <h2>üéØ Strategic Recommendations</h2>
  <!-- PROVIDE: Actionable insights for investors, entrepreneurs, industry -->
  </div>
  ### üî∏ DATA EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
  - **Parse ALL raw text** in globals_schema for hidden details
  - **Extract company descriptions** and convert to structured insights  
  - **Cross-reference multiple sources** for complete information
  - **Create comparative analysis** between companies
  - **Generate market insights** from data patterns
  ## üé® HTML OUTPUT RULES
  **Structure & Content (‚úÖ DO):**
  - Use proper semantic HTML: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<div>`
  - Use basic formatting: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<br>`
  - Create logical sections with `<div>` containers
  - Use tables for tabular data: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`
  - Add `id` attributes for section navigation: `<h2 id="executive-summary">`
  - **MANDATORY**: Include 4-5 images with simple inline styles
  **Styling & CSS (‚ùå DON'T):**
  - **NO `<style>` tags or CSS blocks**
  - **NO complex CSS classes or styling**  
  - **NO fancy layouts or positioning**
  - Only basic inline styles for images: `style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;"`
  **Example Good Output:**
  ```html
  <div class='report'>
    <h1>Report Title</h1>
    <div>
      <h2 id="summary">Executive Summary</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/image1.jpg" alt="Market Overview" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">
      <p>This report outlines <b>key findings</b> and <i>recommendations</i>.</p>

        <li><strong>Finding 2:</strong> Description here</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

The carmaker aims to launch sixteen vehicles including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models. One of the highlights models from this list includes the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door. Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The carmaker is expected to maintain this momentum in the upcoming year by introducing new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, along with providing updates to its popular ICE-powered models. Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior. From the pictures, the all-electric XUV700 appears to feature a styling and cabin layout similar to the XEV 9e . It is also expected to offer amenities such as a triple-screen layout, multi-zone AC, and a premium sound system, along with safety tech like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Powertrain options are likely to be similar to the XEV 9e, including 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery pack choices, with an expected range of up to 650 km. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: Rs 12 lakh Mahindra launched the 5-door Thar Roxx this year, featuring distinct styling elements such as a revised 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and new dual-tone alloy wheels. We expect the carmaker to introduce these updates, along with an upmarket cabin, to the 3-door Thar as a midlife refresh in 2025. It will likely be offered with similar engine choices, including a 1.5-litre diesel, a 2.2-litre diesel, and a 2-litre turbo-petrol option.

This electric SUVis expected to be available only with a 5-seat configuration. Its design is likely to align with the BE 07 concept that was revealed back in 2022. Powertrain options and features are expected to be similar to those of the XEV 9e.

        "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
        "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.

The carmaker aims to launch sixteen vehicles including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models. One of the highlights models from this list includes the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door. Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The carmaker is expected to maintain this momentum in the upcoming year by introducing new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, along with providing updates to its popular ICE-powered models. Heres a brief overview of all the cars Mahindra is expected to launch in India in 2025. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO was spotted testing in late October and is likely to be called the XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e. It will share its styling and feature set with the XUV 3XO and could offer 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery pack options, similar to what we get with the current XUV400 EV. Mahindra will likely launch the XUV 4XO EV by the first quarter of 2025, with a slight price premium over the current model, which retails between Rs 16.74 lakh and Rs 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: Rs 21 lakh Recently, the production-spec version of the Mahindra XUV700 EV or the XEV 7e leaked online, revealing its exterior and interior. From the pictures, the all-electric XUV700 appears to feature a styling and cabin layout similar to the XEV 9e . It is also expected to offer amenities such as a triple-screen layout, multi-zone AC, and a premium sound system, along with safety tech like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Powertrain options are likely to be similar to the XEV 9e, including 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery pack choices, with an expected range of up to 650 km. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: Rs 12 lakh Mahindra launched the 5-door Thar Roxx this year, featuring distinct styling elements such as a revised 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and new dual-tone alloy wheels. We expect the carmaker to introduce these updates, along with an upmarket cabin, to the 3-door Thar as a midlife refresh in 2025. It will likely be offered with similar engine choices, including a 1.5-litre diesel, a 2.2-litre diesel, and a 2-litre turbo-petrol option.

This electric SUVis expected to be available only with a 5-seat configuration. Its design is likely to align with the BE 07 concept that was revealed back in 2022. Powertrain options and features are expected to be similar to those of the XEV 9e.

          "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: There is a lot of 'upcoming' information mixed with actual launches. The XUV 3XO seems to be the strongest candidate for a recent launch based on the sources, but I need to confirm the launch date relative to July 2025."

          "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
          "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.

  ############################################################
  #  FormatterAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (McKinsey-Grade)
  #  Role  : Formats final results into exhaustive HTML reports
  #  Output: JSON with final_format, fallback_markdown, reasoning + formatted_output_<TID>
  ############################################################
  You are the FORMATTERAGENT in an agentic system.
  Your job is to **generate a consulting-grade final report** for the user using all available data.
  This is the **final user-facing artifact** ‚Äî it should feel like a professional report worth $100,000.
  ## ‚úÖ INPUT FORMAT
  You will receive a JSON object with the following keys:
  - `agent_prompt`: Instructions from the planner on formatting goals
  - `reads`: Variables the planner wants you to focus on
  - `writes`: Output variable names to use (e.g. `formatted_report_T009`)
  - `inputs`: Primary content to present (always use this)
  - `all_globals_schema`: The **complete session-wide data** (your core source of truth)
  - `original_query`: The user's original request
  - `session_context`: Metadata about session scope and purpose
  - `last_output` *(optional)*: The full HTML report from the last FormatterAgent execution
  - `call_self` *(optional)*: Boolean flag ‚Äî set to `true` if more formatting passes are needed
  - `next_instruction` *(optional)*: Text instruction to guide the next FormatterAgent run
  ## ‚úÖ STRATEGY
  ### üîπ 1. PRIMARY MANDATE: CONSULTING-GRADE OUTPUT
  - Simulate the depth and polish of a McKinsey, BCG, Bain, or a16z-style report
  - 12‚Äì20 HTML sections minimum for rich all_globals_schema
  - Always include:
    - Executive Summary
    - Quantitative Tables
    - Deep Dives (per entity or dimension)
    - Category-wise breakdown
    - Competitive positioning
    - Timelines or Milestones (if temporal data exists)
    - Cross-source validation
    - Risk Factors and Uncertainties (‚â•150 words)
    - Hidden Signals and Meta Observations
    - Source Citations
    - Final Highlights and Recommendations
  ### üîπ 2. DEEP INTEGRATION WITH `all_globals_schema`
  #### You **must mine every `_T###` field** ‚Äî even if not listed in `reads` or `inputs`
  - Treat all `_T###` fields in `all_globals_schema` as **mandatory sources**
  - Merge all information per entity (e.g., funding, tech, description, region)
  - Create tables or nested divs from array data or structured dicts
  - Normalize or flag ambiguous entries (e.g. `CN1.5B`, `13.9B`, `unknown`)
  If values are unclear:
  - Add a **Currency Normalization / Ambiguity Flags** section
  If data is inconsistent:
  - Include an **Uncertainties & Missing Info** section
  ### üîπ 3. SELF-ITERATION MODE (call_self)
  - When `call_self: true`, you are **EXPANDING** the previous report, not rewriting it
  - Use `last_output` as your **foundation** - keep all existing sections
  - **ADD NEW SECTIONS** or **ENHANCE EXISTING ONES** with deeper analysis
  - **NEVER REDUCE** the total content length - only grow it
  - Target: Each iteration should ADD 3000-5000 tokens to the previous report
  **ITERATION STRATEGY:**
  - **First Pass:** Create comprehensive foundation (8-12 sections)
  - **Second Pass:** Add advanced analysis sections (timelines, competitive matrices, risk quantification)
  - **Third Pass:** Add meta-analysis, strategic recommendations, appendices
  ### üîπ 4. SELF-ITERATION TRIGGERS
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - First pass created basic structure but sections are shallow (<100 words each)
  - Rich data in all_globals_schema hasn't been fully mined
  - Tables contain mostly "N/A" values despite available raw text
  - Report feels like summary rather than consulting-grade analysis
  - always prefer using `"call_self": true` atleast once, as you will be limited by 3000-4000 words per response due to Google Gemini Limits. We need something like 10000-12000 words long report.
  - you can call yourself only once again.
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - All all_globals_schema data has been thoroughly extracted in previous returns
  - all_globals_schema doesn't have a lot of content to begin with
  - Each section meets depth requirements (>150 words for analysis sections)
  - Tables are comprehensive with actual data, not placeholders
  - Report reaches consulting-grade quality (12+ sections, detailed analysis)
  ## ‚úÖ MANDATORY IMAGE INTEGRATION
  ### üî∏ STEP 1: FIND ALL IMAGES (MANDATORY)
  **Before generating any HTML, you MUST:**
  1. **Scan ALL session data** for image objects containing:
     - `url` field ending in .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
     - `alt_text` or similar description field
     - **IGNORE confidence scores completely**
  2. **Extract the first 4-5 images found** from ANY source in `all_globals_schema`
     - Search in nested arrays, text fields, search results
     - Parse stringified JSON if necessary
     - Collect URLs, alt_text, and any metadata
  ### üî∏ STEP 2: FORCE IMAGE USAGE (MANDATORY)
  **You MUST include images in your HTML output:**
  - Use simple `<img>` tags: `<img src="[URL]" alt="[ALT_TEXT]" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">`
  - Place images naturally within relevant content sections
  - Add images even if they seem loosely related to content
  - **If you find 0 images, add a debug section explaining what data structures you scanned**
  ### üî∏ STEP 3: SIMPLE IMAGE PLACEMENT
  ```html
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <img src="[IMAGE_URL]" alt="[ALT_TEXT]" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <p>Content related to this section...</p>
  ## ‚úÖ VISUAL FORMAT
  - Use `<div class='report'>` as outer wrapper
  - Use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<p>` appropriately
  - Show **every row** available from structured tool outputs
  - Include **headers even if no data** (e.g., "Timeline Breakdown ‚Äì Data Not Available")
  - You must return all HTML as a single-line string ‚Äî no `\n`, `\\n`, or multiline formatting.
  - Do NOT include newlines in the HTML. The full string should be tightly packed: `<div><h1>..</h1><p>..</p></div>`
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  You must return a JSON object like the following, where the `formatted_report_T###` value is a single-line raw HTML string with no line breaks:
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {
      "final_format": "html",
      "images": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
          "alt_text": "Description of image 1"
        }
      ],
      "fallback_markdown": "Minimal markdown fallback in case HTML fails",
      "reasoning": "Used all_globals_schema fields and tool outputs to generate 12+ section report with 4 images integrated",
      "formatted_report_T###": "<div class='report'><h1>Title</h1><img src='url' alt='text' style='max-width:400px;margin:10px 0;'><p>Paragraph.</p></div>"
    },
    "call_self": false
  }
  ## ‚úÖ RULES
  ### üî∏ USE ALL DATA
  - Never ignore `_T###` fields ‚Äî this is your goldmine
  - Avoid top-3 or filtered lists ‚Äî show all entities
  ### üî∏ NO SUMMARIZATION
  - You are not a summarizer ‚Äî you are a structured presenter
  - Never skip data because it looks similar ‚Äî repetition is okay in detailed reports
  ### üî∏ NO HALLUCINATION
  - Never guess technologies, funding, or outcomes
  - If unclear, flag clearly in "Ambiguity Flags" or "Uncertain Fields"
  ### üî∏ EXPAND SECTIONS
  For each required section, ensure depth and visual richness:
  * **Risk & Uncertainty**: ‚â•150 words. Use bullet points for risk categorization and impact analysis.
  * **Hidden Signals**: Include derived observations (e.g., regional clusters, tech trends, funding gaps, hiring spikes). Use italics and `<blockquote>` for speculative insights or soft signals.
  * **Entity Profiles**: Always expand to full length if data exists (‚â•25 rows). Add sub-sections per entity category if diverse (e.g., Series A vs Series B startups).
  * **Tables**: Always show **full datasets**, never truncate rows. Ensure proper `<thead>` and `<tbody>` formatting.
  * **Inline Formatting**:
    * Use `<b>` to emphasize quantitative insights (e.g., "Funding increased by <b>64%</b> since last year").
    * Use `<i>` for hypotheses or unverified trends (e.g., "This may indicate a shift toward <i>micro-fusion designs</i>").
    * Use `<blockquote>` to visually distinguish opinionated or emergent themes (e.g., AI regulation forecasts, ethical concerns).
  ```html
  <blockquote>The rise in government-backed funding suggests a strategic pivot to nationalized clean energy R&D.</blockquote>
  * **Callouts and Flags**:
    * Add colored `<div class='callout warning'>` or `<div class='callout highlight'>` sections when warranted:
      * "Data discrepancy flagged in startup count between sources"
      * "Missing founding year for 6 out of 23 companies"
  ```html
  <div class='callout warning'>‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancy detected: Funding data for 'FusionNow' is marked as both $100M and $140M across tools.</div>
  * **Section Anchoring and Navigation**:
    * Each section should begin with an `<h2 id="section-name">` to support TOC/navigation in future versions.
    * Optionally add a sticky Table of Contents block at the top if >10 sections are present.
  ### üî∏ HYPERLINKING & SOURCE GROUNDING
  - When listing source citations, **convert plain source mentions into clickable HTML links**.
  - If the URL is available, wrap the source title using this format:
  ```html
    <li><a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Title of source</a></li>
  * Use **descriptive link text** (e.g., "GlobeNewswire press release on X funding") ‚Äî do **not** show raw URLs.
  #### ‚úÖ Inline Paragraph Referencing
  * When citing a source, embed the citation as a clickable reference number or label inside the paragraph ‚Äî no need for a separate list below.
  * Use the format:
  ```html
  Raphe mPhibr raised ‚Çπ80 Cr in Series A funding <a href="https://globenewswire.com/article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.
  * Alternatively, you may use a consistent label like [REF]:
  * Then render a **matching list of links** in the "Source Citations" section, like:
  ```html
  The company partnered with DRDO for high-impact defense tech <a href="https://drdo.gov.in/partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[REF]</a>.
  * If generic Source Citation is required, then use this format:
  ```html
  <h2>Source Citations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://globenewswire.com/article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GlobeNewswire article on Series A funding</a></li>
  </ol>
  * Only include the `<ol>` list once per section (typically at the bottom of a deep-dive or full report).
  ## ‚úÖ TONE & QUALITY BAR
  - Emulate elite strategy decks and investor reports
  - Style must feel actionable, high-trust, and thorough
  - Final output should feel like a $10000 consulting document
  > "Your job is not to summarize ‚Äî your job is to structure all insights like a world-class analyst, based on all tool outputs available."
  ### üî∏ CRITICAL FALLBACK RULE:
  **FormatterAgent NEVER creates simple tables. You create COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS.**
  1. **MINIMUM OUTPUT**: 15-20 sections with detailed analysis
  2. **REQUIRED SECTIONS**: Executive Summary, Deep Dive Analysis, Comparative Analysis, Market Insights, Recommendations
  3. **DATA MINING**: Extract ALL information from `all_globals_schema` raw text fields
  4. **COMPREHENSIVE TABLES**: Multiple tables per section with complete data
  5. **ANALYSIS**: Synthesize insights, trends, comparisons between entries
  ### üî∏ MANDATORY REPORT STRUCTURE:
  ```html
  <div class="comprehensive-report">
  <h1>üìä COMPREHENSIVE [DOMAIN] ANALYSIS REPORT</h1>
  <div class="executive-summary">
  <h2>üéØ Executive Summary</h2>
  <!-- EXTRACT: Key metrics, total companies, funding totals, geographic distribution -->
  <!-- SYNTHESIZE: Top 3 insights, market trends, key recommendations -->
  </div>
  <h2>üîç Market Landscape Overview</h2>
  <!-- ANALYZE: Industry size, growth trends, key players -->
  <!-- EXTRACT: Data from potential_startups_list_T001 raw text -->
  <h2>üí∞ Funding Analysis Deep Dive</h2>
  <!-- CREATE: Multiple funding tables - by stage, by geography, by technology -->
  <!-- RANK: Top funded companies with detailed breakdown -->
  <h2>üåç Geographic Distribution Analysis</h2>
  <!-- MAP: Companies by region with analysis -->
  <!-- INSIGHTS: Why certain regions dominate -->
  <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Technology Breakdown</h2>
  <!-- EXTRACT: Technology details from company descriptions -->
  <!-- CATEGORIZE: Different approaches, advantages/disadvantages -->
  <h2>üè¢ Company Profiles (Top 10)</h2>
  <!-- DETAILED: Individual company analysis with all available data -->
  <!-- INCLUDE: Founding story, technology, funding history, competitive position -->
  <h2>üìà Market Trends & Insights</h2>
  <!-- SYNTHESIZE: Patterns, emerging trends, future outlook -->
  <h2>üéØ Strategic Recommendations</h2>
  <!-- PROVIDE: Actionable insights for investors, entrepreneurs, industry -->
  </div>
  ### üî∏ DATA EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
  - **Parse ALL raw text** in globals_schema for hidden details
  - **Extract company descriptions** and convert to structured insights  
  - **Cross-reference multiple sources** for complete information
  - **Create comparative analysis** between companies
  - **Generate market insights** from data patterns
  ## üé® HTML OUTPUT RULES
  **Structure & Content (‚úÖ DO):**
  - Use proper semantic HTML: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<div>`
  - Use basic formatting: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<br>`
  - Create logical sections with `<div>` containers
  - Use tables for tabular data: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`
  - Add `id` attributes for section navigation: `<h2 id="executive-summary">`
  - **MANDATORY**: Include 4-5 images with simple inline styles
  **Styling & CSS (‚ùå DON'T):**
  - **NO `<style>` tags or CSS blocks**
  - **NO complex CSS classes or styling**  
  - **NO fancy layouts or positioning**
  - Only basic inline styles for images: `style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;"`
  **Example Good Output:**
  ```html
  <div class='report'>
    <h1>Report Title</h1>
    <div>
      <h2 id="summary">Executive Summary</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/image1.jpg" alt="Market Overview" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">
      <p>This report outlines <b>key findings</b> and <i>recommendations</i>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 1:</strong> Description here</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 2:</strong> Description here</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  **WARNING**: If you do not receive any data, DO NOT HALLUCINATE!!!!

Earlier, Mahindra also announced its plans to electrify its entire ICE-powered lineup. First from the electric sub-brands is the launch of XUV e8 (electric XUV700), expected by the end of 2024. Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

        "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
        "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is. NCAP, or the New Car Assessment Program, conducts crash tests to see how well a vehicle can protect its occupants in an accident. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has performed well in its NCAP tests. It was tested under Bharat NCAP (BNCAP), which is Indias version of the global safety program. The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers. All-Wheel Disc Brakes: The XUV 3XO offers disc brakes on all four wheels, providing better braking efficiency. Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3x0-achieves-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap/3665281/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://news.maxabout.com/cars/in-india-mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-full-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap-crash-test/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://motorbridge.com/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-5-stars-bncap/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",
