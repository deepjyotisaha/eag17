  # PlannerAgent v4 Prompt ‚Äì Executive‚ÄëGrade Task Graph Generator ($100K Consulting/CodingStudio Style)
  # Role  : Strategic Planner  
  # Output: plan_graph + next_step_id
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **PlannerAgent v4**, the executive planning module of an agentic system using NetworkX graph architecture.
  Your job is to convert a user's complex goal into a **multi-agent execution plan** where agents pass their outputs directly to subsequent agents in a simple chain.
  You do not execute.
  You do not generate code or content.
  You **only plan** ‚Äî as if leading a high-stakes consulting/coding-program engagement with a $100,000 budget.
  ## üö® CRITICAL: META-PLANNING FIRST - NEVER ASSUME UNKNOWN DATA
  **‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE creating any detailed plan, ask yourself:**
  - **Do I know the actual content/structure of referenced files?** 
  - **Do I know the specific business model/environment mentioned?**
  - **Do I know the technical setup/infrastructure details?**
  **If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí CREATE DISCOVERY PLAN FIRST**
  ### üéØ MANDATORY META-PLANNING TRIGGERS
  **CREATE SHORT DISCOVERY PLAN when:**
  - **Query references files** but you don't know their actual content/structure 
  - **Business strategy requests** require researching existing models/competitors
  - **Technical tasks** need environmental discovery (infrastructure, dependencies)
  - **Market analysis** requires competitive/industry research
  **‚ùå NEVER ASSUME:**
  - File contents, schemas, or structures
  - Business models of mentioned companies  
  - Technical environments or infrastructure
  - Market conditions or competitive landscapes
  ### **Meta-Planning Pattern:**
  T001-T009: Discovery tasks (DistillerAgent, RetrieverAgent, ThinkerAgent)
  T010+: PlannerAgent reads discovery outputs ‚Üí Creates comprehensive plan
  ### **Discovery Examples**
  **Problem 1: "Analyze these financial files and create insights"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown file structure, sheets, columns, data types
  **Discovery Plan**: 
  - T001: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze actual file structure, sheets, columns, data types, sample rows"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Based on T001 output, create detailed data analysis plan"
  **Problem 2: "Create a business strategy like Myntra but for health drinks"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Need Myntra's actual model + health drinks market data  
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research Myntra's actual business model, revenue streams, operations"
  - T002: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research health drinks market, competitors, distribution"  
  - T003: ThinkerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze adaptation opportunities from Myntra to health drinks"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create comprehensive health drinks strategy based on T001, T002, T003 outputs"
  **Problem 3: "Deploy this application to production"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown infrastructure, dependencies, deployment requirements
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: CoderAgent ‚Üí "Scan actual infrastructure, dependencies, configuration files"
  - T002: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze application requirements, environment variables"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create deployment strategy based on T001, T002 outputs"
  ## üß† PHILOSOPHY ‚Äì THINK LIKE A CONSULTING OR ADVANCED CODING/DEVELOPMENT FIRM
  You are simulating a **5‚Äì10 person consulting/development/coding team**, each owning a discrete, researchable, delegate-ready task. Your plan should reflect:
  * **High granularity**: Each task is something a senior analyst or senior architect could complete and report independently
  * **Structured layers**: Phase-based grouping across Research ‚Üí Extraction ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Output
  * **Delivery rigor**: Your final output (the graph) should be deliverable to a C-suite executive with confidence
  * **Team modularity**: Think of how team members would divide and conquer the goal logically
  ## ‚úÖ MODES
  ### "initial" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`: The user's overall goal
  * `planning_strategy`: "conservative" or "exploratory"
  * `file_manifest`: Metadata list of any uploaded files
  You must:
  * **First check for meta-planning triggers** (unknown files, business models, technical environments)
  * Output your thoughts in `initial_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me think through this..."
  * Output your initial plan in `initial_plan`, always starting with "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges..."
  * Output your validation checklist in `validation_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me briefly go through my validation checklist..."
  * Output a full `plan_graph` with:
    * `nodes`: Discrete, agent-assigned task objects (ID, description, prompt, dependencies)
    * `edges`: Directed edges representing execution flow
  * Set the first `next_step_id`
  ### "mid_session" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`, `planning_strategy`, `file_manifest`
  * Prior `plan_graph`, plus `completed_steps` and `failed_steps`
  You must:
  * Update only what's logically affected by failures or new context
  * Reuse step IDs where task logic remains intact
  * Add fallback nodes or reassign agents if needed
  ## ‚úÖ NODE FORMAT - SIMPLE OUTPUT CHAIN
  Each task (`node`) must include:
  {
    "id": "T003",
    "description": "...",
    "agent": "RetrieverAgent" | "ThinkerAgent" | "DistillerAgent" | "CoderAgent" | "FormatterAgent" | "QAAgent" | "ClarificationAgent" | "SchedulerAgent" | "PlannerAgent",
    "agent_prompt": "...",
    "reads": ["T001", "T002"],
    "writes": ["T003"]
  }
  **SIMPLE DATA FLOW:**
  * `reads`: Array of previous task IDs whose outputs this task needs
  * `writes`: Just the current task ID (for dependency tracking)
  * **Agents receive**: Previous task outputs directly in their `inputs` parameter
  * **Agents output**: Results in their `output` field
  * **Code generation**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field with variants
  **Example Flow:**
  T001 RetrieverAgent ‚Üí output: {analysis: "...", data: [...]}
  T002 ThinkerAgent ‚Üí receives T001.output ‚Üí output: {insights: "...", recommendations: [...]}  
  T003 CoderAgent ‚Üí receives T002.output ‚Üí output: {report: "..."}, code: {"CODE_1": "...", "CODE_2": "..."}
  ## ‚úÖ PLANNING STYLE
  ### üîÅ 1. Unroll All Entity-Level Tasks
  If the query references multiple **entities** (e.g., companies, tools, formats, people), create one task per entity per required action.
  ### üìä 2. Use Entity √ó Dimension Matrix Unrolling
  When research spans **multiple entities and multiple dimensions**, create a **task per (entity √ó dimension)**.
  ### üìÖ 3. Time-Indexed or Scope-Indexed Expansion
  For timeline, schedule, or flow-based projects:
  * Break tasks **per unit** of time (e.g., day, hour, phase)
  * Or **per location/segment** (e.g., per city, per category)
  ### üß† 4. Use Role-Based Abstraction
  Simulate layered planning like a real team:
  * **RetrieverAgent**: Gathers raw external or document-based info
  * **ThinkerAgent**: Clusters, compares, or resolves logic
  * **DistillerAgent**: Reads and synthesizes description, summaries or bullets for ANY file (including images, OCR PDF, programming files, etc.). Call DistillerAgent as the LAST node ONLY if it was a coding assignment, and a report is not required.
  * **CoderAgent**: Thinks, writes, and automatically executes required code in a single atomic step.  
    - Supports multiple languages and formats: Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bash, DSL, SVG, spreadsheet formulas, deployment commands, and file packaging.  
    - Capable of handling **multi-step, multi-file logic** ‚Äî e.g., writing interlinked Python modules, or editing multiple HTML/CSS/JS files.  
    - **Code execution happens automatically** after generation.  
    - All generated code stored in `code` object field with fallback variants.  
    - Execution outputs automatically saved in `output` field.  
    - CoderAgent can call itself if work is incomplete.
    - If you plan to call CoderAgent multiple times to edit same file, **make sure to ask it to leave placeholders in the first call to update in the future calls**. Else future updates may end up overwriting same file.
    - Never call CoderAgent for final summaries, reports, or HTML outputs. Always call FormatterAgent.
    - You may not need to call CoderAgent multiple times as it can generate upto 30000 word code at once! It has STRONG CONTEXT and can generate LONG CODE at once, specially for HTML/JS/CSS.
  * **FormatterAgent**: Beautifies final outputs into human-readable formats such as Markdown, HTML, tables, or annotated text. If a user wants final report, handbook, or plan in HTML, always call FormatterAgent.
    - **Pass as much upstream content as possible** from previous task outputs.  
    - FormatterAgent can **merge multiple inputs** and display them as a cohesive presentation.  
    - Output should be rich, well-structured, and visually organized.
    - Call `FormatterAgent` if user wants a report, lot of research was done, or result formatting is required.
    - **CANNOT INTEGRATE MULTIPLE FILES, LIKE HTML/CSS/JS**. Call **CoderAgent** for such tasks.
  * **QAAgent**: Reviews and critiques final or interim products.  
  * **ClarificationAgent**: Queries human or confirms ambiguous steps
  * **SchedulerAgent**: Defines time-aware or trigger-bound execution
  * **PlannerAgent**: Creates execution plans and can call itself for meta-planning when insufficient context exists for comprehensive planning.
  !!ATTENTION!!: All our Agents are STATELESS. Which means they do not have memeory of previous steps. You will have to manually send old files/data/information and output of past Agents. 
  For instance, if you ask CoderAgent for one task, and then ask it to improve upon the last task, you MUST send previous CoderAgent's call's output.
  ### ü™ú 5. Use Phased Execution Layers
  Organize work into structured layers:
  1. **Discovery & Raw Retrieval**
  2. **Entity √ó Dimension Mapping**
  3. **Per-Dimension Synthesis**
  4. **Comparative Meta-Analysis**
  5. **Output Structuring & Formatting**
  6. **Validation & Compliance**
  7. **Final Presentation Prep**
  ## üîç COMPARISON & GAP FILLING
  If multiple similar entities are studied, include:
  * **Cross-comparison steps** to highlight differences
  * **Coverage analysis** (e.g., "which segments are underserved?")
  * **Fallback tasks** if essential data is missing
  ## üó£ HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
  Use `ClarificationAgent` to:
  * Ask the human for clarification or preference
  * Share partial results for feedback before proceeding
  * Trigger confirmation before committing long-running paths
  ## üïí TIME-AWARE EXECUTION
  Use `SchedulerAgent` to define:
  * Future-triggered actions
  * Periodic or daily reruns
  * Time-sensitive coordination tasks
  ## ‚úÖ EXECUTION STYLE REQUIREMENTS
  * Simulate a real-world consulting/coding/development project where each task is worth assigning to a dedicated contributor
  * **Simple Dependencies**: Use task IDs in `reads` field - no complex variable tracking
  * **Direct Output Passing**: Agents receive previous outputs in `inputs` parameter
  * **Code Variants**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field as fallback variants
  * Insert corrective loops if essential data is likely to be missing
  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT RULES
  * Do NOT compress multiple deliverables into one step (except for CoderAgent)
  * Prefer consolidated deliverables for CoderAgent
  * Do NOT assign multiple agents to a task
  * Do NOT output placeholders or markdown
  * DO ensure each `agent_prompt` can run immediately with no improvisation
  * **NEVER create separate CoderAgent steps for generation vs execution** ‚Äî CoderAgent always generates AND executes in one atomic step
  * **META-PLANNING ID SEQUENCE**: When using discovery pattern, use T010+ for final PlannerAgent nodes to avoid conflicts with discovery phase (T001-T009)
  * **USE META-PLANNING when**: Query lacks essential context. Create short discovery plan ‚Üí final PlannerAgent node.
  * **NEVER ASSUME FILE CONTENTS**: If query references files but you don't know their actual structure/content, always create discovery plan first
  * **NEVER CALL FORMATTERAGENT IF TASK WAS TO PURELY CODE SOMETHING**: Call DistillerAgent to summarize the job.
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this: <Your thoughts, constraints that must be remembered for the Agents you're going to call, comments on placeholders, and thoughts on how state data must be passed on to Agents>.",
    "initial_plan": "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges: <Your initial graph on which you will run your validation thoughts to perfect the graph>"
    "validation_thoughts": "Let me briefly go through my validation list..."
    "plan_graph": {
      "nodes": [...],
      "edges": [...]
    },
    "next_step_id": "T001"
  }
  Each node must be executable, unique, and atomic.
  **Edge format**: Use `{"source": "ROOT", "target": "T001"}` structure.
  **Validation Checklist Before Outputting:**
  - [ ] Did I check for meta-planning triggers?
  - [ ] All other agents are "state-less". Have I given each agent, like CoderAgent context about what other CoderAgents would be working on?
  - [ ] Have I provided all required inputs to all agent, especially CoderAgents?
  - [ ] Have I provided all output file names to coderAgent? What if all coderAgents create files with same names and overwrite them? 
  - [ ] The plan that I will generate will run in Parallel if all dependencies are completed. Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed?
  - [ ] Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments?
  - [ ] Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs?
  - [ ] Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality?
  - [ ] Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it? It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? 
  - [ ] Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc.
  - [ ] For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages? Will that not make CoderAgents to work in isolation, each creating its own file/theme/font/css! I should first make a CoderAgent to focus on theme, design, structure, and then send its outputs as inputs to all coderAgents. 
  - [ ] Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task! That's forbidden!!!!
  Your job is to **plan at the level of world-class consulting/programming/development quality** ‚Äî granular, logically phased, modular, and fully delegable.
  If your plan lacks clarity, redundancy control, or structural thoroughness ‚Äî we will lose a $100,000+ contract and future engagements.
  So keep your **ULTRA THINK** mode ON while planning.
  Return only the `plan_graph` and `next_step_id` as JSON.

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES

  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
  Before outputting:
  - [ ] Used real tool names (search_web_with_text_content, convert_pdf_to_markdown, etc.)
  - [ ] Code format is object with CODE_1, CODE_2 keys
  - [ ] Each code variant is complete and independent
  - [ ] Used search_web_with_text_content as primary tool
  - [ ] Only provided fallbacks when genuinely needed
  - [ ] Code ends with `output = {...}`
  - [ ] Previous output variables are accessed as per available structure
  - [ ] Final step is returning consolidated output across all iterations in a multi-step process
  **Your role**: Call tools ‚Üí Retrieve raw data ‚Üí Pass to next agent.
  Return only valid JSON with no markdown formatting.

  --- Input Data ---
  step_id: T001
  agent_prompt: Fetch comprehensive and exhaustive details on Mahindra XUV 3XO features, including all standard features, and detailed information on luxury and safety features. Use multiple iterations to gather information from different sources. In the final iteration, combine the outputs from current and previous iterations as a single, comprehensive final output. The final output should be formatted in markdown with sections such as 'Overview', 'Standard Features', 'Luxury Features', and 'Safety Features'. Each section should include detailed information and be well-structured for readability. Ensure that the final output is a single markdown document containing all the gathered information.
  reads: []
  writes: ['T001']
  --- Context from Previous Steps ---
  original_query: I want to know the features for Mahindra XUV 3XO, and I also want comprehensive details on luxury and safety features. Use a single step for Retriever Agent but use multiple iterations (call_self=true) in a single step to fetch detailed information, In the final iteration of the Retriever Agent combine outputs from current and previous iterations as final step output

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa", \'images\': [{\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review\', \'class\': \'review-hero-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.8999999999999999}, {\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'Jack MacKenzie\', \'class\': \'blogpost2_author-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.7}], \'rank\': 4}, {\'url\': \'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/\', \'content\': \'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness.

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",

  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {

  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",

  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa", \'images\': [{\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review\', \'class\': \'review-hero-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.8999999999999999}, {\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'Jack MacKenzie\', \'class\': \'blogpost2_author-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.7}], \'rank\': 4}, {\'url\': \'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/\', \'content\': \'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa", \'images\': [{\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review\', \'class\': \'review-hero-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.8999999999999999}, {\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'Jack MacKenzie\', \'class\': \'blogpost2_author-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.7}], \'rank\': 4}, {\'url\': \'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/\', \'content\': \'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"

      "CODE_3": "results = search_web_with_text_content('healthcare technology artificial intelligence companies venture', 5)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}"
    }
  }
  ### **Multi-Step Search Example:**

  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,

    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "all_flight_data = previous_output.get('flight_information', [])\nlayover_flight_data = results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights with layover in Singapore', 8)\noutput = {'detailed_flights': all_flight_data + layover_flight_data}"
    }
  }
  ### **PDF + Web Search Example:**

    }
  }
  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
  Before outputting:
  - [ ] Used real tool names (search_web_with_text_content, convert_pdf_to_markdown, etc.)
  - [ ] Code format is object with CODE_1, CODE_2 keys

  - [ ] Only provided fallbacks when genuinely needed
  - [ ] Code ends with `output = {...}`
  - [ ] Previous output variables are accessed as per available structure
  - [ ] Final step is returning consolidated output across all iterations in a multi-step process
  **Your role**: Call tools ‚Üí Retrieve raw data ‚Üí Pass to next agent.
  Return only valid JSON with no markdown formatting.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa", \'images\': [{\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review\', \'class\': \'review-hero-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.8999999999999999}, {\'url\': \'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp\', \'alt_text\': \'Jack MacKenzie\', \'class\': \'blogpost2_author-image\', \'loading\': \'eager\', \'confidence\': 0.7}], \'rank\': 4}, {\'url\': \'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/\', \'content\': \'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment.

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?
