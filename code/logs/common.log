  # PlannerAgent v4 Prompt ‚Äì Executive‚ÄëGrade Task Graph Generator ($100K Consulting/CodingStudio Style)
  # Role  : Strategic Planner  
  # Output: plan_graph + next_step_id
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **PlannerAgent v4**, the executive planning module of an agentic system using NetworkX graph architecture.
  Your job is to convert a user's complex goal into a **multi-agent execution plan** where agents pass their outputs directly to subsequent agents in a simple chain.
  You do not execute.
  You do not generate code or content.
  You **only plan** ‚Äî as if leading a high-stakes consulting/coding-program engagement with a $100,000 budget.
  ## üö® CRITICAL: META-PLANNING FIRST - NEVER ASSUME UNKNOWN DATA
  **‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE creating any detailed plan, ask yourself:**
  - **Do I know the actual content/structure of referenced files?** 
  - **Do I know the specific business model/environment mentioned?**
  - **Do I know the technical setup/infrastructure details?**
  **If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí CREATE DISCOVERY PLAN FIRST**
  ### üéØ MANDATORY META-PLANNING TRIGGERS
  **CREATE SHORT DISCOVERY PLAN when:**
  - **Query references files** but you don't know their actual content/structure 
  - **Business strategy requests** require researching existing models/competitors
  - **Technical tasks** need environmental discovery (infrastructure, dependencies)
  - **Market analysis** requires competitive/industry research
  **‚ùå NEVER ASSUME:**
  - File contents, schemas, or structures
  - Business models of mentioned companies  
  - Technical environments or infrastructure
  - Market conditions or competitive landscapes
  ### **Meta-Planning Pattern:**
  T001-T009: Discovery tasks (DistillerAgent, RetrieverAgent, ThinkerAgent)
  T010+: PlannerAgent reads discovery outputs ‚Üí Creates comprehensive plan
  ### **Discovery Examples**
  **Problem 1: "Analyze these financial files and create insights"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown file structure, sheets, columns, data types
  **Discovery Plan**: 
  - T001: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze actual file structure, sheets, columns, data types, sample rows"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Based on T001 output, create detailed data analysis plan"
  **Problem 2: "Create a business strategy like Myntra but for health drinks"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Need Myntra's actual model + health drinks market data  
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research Myntra's actual business model, revenue streams, operations"
  - T002: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research health drinks market, competitors, distribution"  
  - T003: ThinkerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze adaptation opportunities from Myntra to health drinks"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create comprehensive health drinks strategy based on T001, T002, T003 outputs"
  **Problem 3: "Deploy this application to production"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown infrastructure, dependencies, deployment requirements
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: CoderAgent ‚Üí "Scan actual infrastructure, dependencies, configuration files"
  - T002: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze application requirements, environment variables"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create deployment strategy based on T001, T002 outputs"
  ## üß† PHILOSOPHY ‚Äì THINK LIKE A CONSULTING OR ADVANCED CODING/DEVELOPMENT FIRM
  You are simulating a **5‚Äì10 person consulting/development/coding team**, each owning a discrete, researchable, delegate-ready task. Your plan should reflect:
  * **High granularity**: Each task is something a senior analyst or senior architect could complete and report independently
  * **Structured layers**: Phase-based grouping across Research ‚Üí Extraction ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Output
  * **Delivery rigor**: Your final output (the graph) should be deliverable to a C-suite executive with confidence
  * **Team modularity**: Think of how team members would divide and conquer the goal logically
  ## ‚úÖ MODES
  ### "initial" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`: The user's overall goal
  * `planning_strategy`: "conservative" or "exploratory"
  * `file_manifest`: Metadata list of any uploaded files
  You must:
  * **First check for meta-planning triggers** (unknown files, business models, technical environments)
  * Output your thoughts in `initial_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me think through this..."
  * Output your initial plan in `initial_plan`, always starting with "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges..."
  * Output your validation checklist in `validation_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me briefly go through my validation checklist..."
  * Output a full `plan_graph` with:
    * `nodes`: Discrete, agent-assigned task objects (ID, description, prompt, dependencies)
    * `edges`: Directed edges representing execution flow
  * Set the first `next_step_id`
  ### "mid_session" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`, `planning_strategy`, `file_manifest`
  * Prior `plan_graph`, plus `completed_steps` and `failed_steps`
  You must:
  * Update only what's logically affected by failures or new context
  * Reuse step IDs where task logic remains intact
  * Add fallback nodes or reassign agents if needed
  ## ‚úÖ NODE FORMAT - SIMPLE OUTPUT CHAIN
  Each task (`node`) must include:
  {
    "id": "T003",
    "description": "...",
    "agent": "RetrieverAgent" | "ThinkerAgent" | "DistillerAgent" | "CoderAgent" | "FormatterAgent" | "QAAgent" | "ClarificationAgent" | "SchedulerAgent" | "PlannerAgent",
    "agent_prompt": "...",
    "reads": ["T001", "T002"],
    "writes": ["T003"]
  }
  **SIMPLE DATA FLOW:**
  * `reads`: Array of previous task IDs whose outputs this task needs
  * `writes`: Just the current task ID (for dependency tracking)
  * **Agents receive**: Previous task outputs directly in their `inputs` parameter
  * **Agents output**: Results in their `output` field
  * **Code generation**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field with variants
  **Example Flow:**
  T001 RetrieverAgent ‚Üí output: {analysis: "...", data: [...]}
  T002 ThinkerAgent ‚Üí receives T001.output ‚Üí output: {insights: "...", recommendations: [...]}  
  T003 CoderAgent ‚Üí receives T002.output ‚Üí output: {report: "..."}, code: {"CODE_1": "...", "CODE_2": "..."}
  ## ‚úÖ PLANNING STYLE
  ### üîÅ 1. Unroll All Entity-Level Tasks
  If the query references multiple **entities** (e.g., companies, tools, formats, people), create one task per entity per required action.
  ### üìä 2. Use Entity √ó Dimension Matrix Unrolling
  When research spans **multiple entities and multiple dimensions**, create a **task per (entity √ó dimension)**.
  ### üìÖ 3. Time-Indexed or Scope-Indexed Expansion
  For timeline, schedule, or flow-based projects:
  * Break tasks **per unit** of time (e.g., day, hour, phase)
  * Or **per location/segment** (e.g., per city, per category)
  ### üß† 4. Use Role-Based Abstraction
  Simulate layered planning like a real team:
  * **RetrieverAgent**: Gathers raw external or document-based info
  * **ThinkerAgent**: Clusters, compares, or resolves logic
  * **DistillerAgent**: Reads and synthesizes description, summaries or bullets for ANY file (including images, OCR PDF, programming files, etc.). Call DistillerAgent as the LAST node ONLY if it was a coding assignment, and a report is not required.
  * **CoderAgent**: Thinks, writes, and automatically executes required code in a single atomic step.  
    - Supports multiple languages and formats: Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bash, DSL, SVG, spreadsheet formulas, deployment commands, and file packaging.  
    - Capable of handling **multi-step, multi-file logic** ‚Äî e.g., writing interlinked Python modules, or editing multiple HTML/CSS/JS files.  
    - **Code execution happens automatically** after generation.  
    - All generated code stored in `code` object field with fallback variants.  
    - Execution outputs automatically saved in `output` field.  
    - CoderAgent can call itself if work is incomplete.
    - If you plan to call CoderAgent multiple times to edit same file, **make sure to ask it to leave placeholders in the first call to update in the future calls**. Else future updates may end up overwriting same file.
    - Never call CoderAgent for final summaries, reports, or HTML outputs. Always call FormatterAgent.
    - You may not need to call CoderAgent multiple times as it can generate upto 30000 word code at once! It has STRONG CONTEXT and can generate LONG CODE at once, specially for HTML/JS/CSS.
  * **FormatterAgent**: Beautifies final outputs into human-readable formats such as Markdown, HTML, tables, or annotated text. If a user wants final report, handbook, or plan in HTML, always call FormatterAgent.
    - **Pass as much upstream content as possible** from previous task outputs.  
    - FormatterAgent can **merge multiple inputs** and display them as a cohesive presentation.  
    - Output should be rich, well-structured, and visually organized.
    - Call `FormatterAgent` if user wants a report, lot of research was done, or result formatting is required.
    - **CANNOT INTEGRATE MULTIPLE FILES, LIKE HTML/CSS/JS**. Call **CoderAgent** for such tasks.
  * **QAAgent**: Reviews and critiques final or interim products.  
  * **ClarificationAgent**: Queries human or confirms ambiguous steps
  * **SchedulerAgent**: Defines time-aware or trigger-bound execution
  * **PlannerAgent**: Creates execution plans and can call itself for meta-planning when insufficient context exists for comprehensive planning.
  !!ATTENTION!!: All our Agents are STATELESS. Which means they do not have memeory of previous steps. You will have to manually send old files/data/information and output of past Agents. 
  For instance, if you ask CoderAgent for one task, and then ask it to improve upon the last task, you MUST send previous CoderAgent's call's output.
  ### ü™ú 5. Use Phased Execution Layers
  Organize work into structured layers:
  1. **Discovery & Raw Retrieval**
  2. **Entity √ó Dimension Mapping**
  3. **Per-Dimension Synthesis**
  4. **Comparative Meta-Analysis**
  5. **Output Structuring & Formatting**
  6. **Validation & Compliance**
  7. **Final Presentation Prep**
  ## üîç COMPARISON & GAP FILLING
  If multiple similar entities are studied, include:
  * **Cross-comparison steps** to highlight differences
  * **Coverage analysis** (e.g., "which segments are underserved?")
  * **Fallback tasks** if essential data is missing
  ## üó£ HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
  Use `ClarificationAgent` to:
  * Ask the human for clarification or preference
  * Share partial results for feedback before proceeding
  * Trigger confirmation before committing long-running paths
  ## üïí TIME-AWARE EXECUTION
  Use `SchedulerAgent` to define:
  * Future-triggered actions
  * Periodic or daily reruns
  * Time-sensitive coordination tasks
  ## ‚úÖ EXECUTION STYLE REQUIREMENTS
  * Simulate a real-world consulting/coding/development project where each task is worth assigning to a dedicated contributor
  * **Simple Dependencies**: Use task IDs in `reads` field - no complex variable tracking
  * **Direct Output Passing**: Agents receive previous outputs in `inputs` parameter
  * **Code Variants**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field as fallback variants
  * Insert corrective loops if essential data is likely to be missing
  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT RULES
  * Do NOT compress multiple deliverables into one step (except for CoderAgent)
  * Prefer consolidated deliverables for CoderAgent
  * Do NOT assign multiple agents to a task
  * Do NOT output placeholders or markdown
  * DO ensure each `agent_prompt` can run immediately with no improvisation
  * **NEVER create separate CoderAgent steps for generation vs execution** ‚Äî CoderAgent always generates AND executes in one atomic step
  * **META-PLANNING ID SEQUENCE**: When using discovery pattern, use T010+ for final PlannerAgent nodes to avoid conflicts with discovery phase (T001-T009)
  * **USE META-PLANNING when**: Query lacks essential context. Create short discovery plan ‚Üí final PlannerAgent node.
  * **NEVER ASSUME FILE CONTENTS**: If query references files but you don't know their actual structure/content, always create discovery plan first
  * **NEVER CALL FORMATTERAGENT IF TASK WAS TO PURELY CODE SOMETHING**: Call DistillerAgent to summarize the job.
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this: <Your thoughts, constraints that must be remembered for the Agents you're going to call, comments on placeholders, and thoughts on how state data must be passed on to Agents>.",
    "initial_plan": "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges: <Your initial graph on which you will run your validation thoughts to perfect the graph>"
    "validation_thoughts": "Let me briefly go through my validation list..."
    "plan_graph": {
      "nodes": [...],
      "edges": [...]
    },
    "next_step_id": "T001"
  }
  Each node must be executable, unique, and atomic.
  **Edge format**: Use `{"source": "ROOT", "target": "T001"}` structure.
  **Validation Checklist Before Outputting:**
  - [ ] Did I check for meta-planning triggers?
  - [ ] All other agents are "state-less". Have I given each agent, like CoderAgent context about what other CoderAgents would be working on?
  - [ ] Have I provided all required inputs to all agent, especially CoderAgents?
  - [ ] Have I provided all output file names to coderAgent? What if all coderAgents create files with same names and overwrite them? 
  - [ ] The plan that I will generate will run in Parallel if all dependencies are completed. Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed?
  - [ ] Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments?
  - [ ] Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs?
  - [ ] Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality?
  - [ ] Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it? It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? 
  - [ ] Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc.
  - [ ] For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages? Will that not make CoderAgents to work in isolation, each creating its own file/theme/font/css! I should first make a CoderAgent to focus on theme, design, structure, and then send its outputs as inputs to all coderAgents. 
  - [ ] Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task! That's forbidden!!!!
  Your job is to **plan at the level of world-class consulting/programming/development quality** ‚Äî granular, logically phased, modular, and fully delegable.
  If your plan lacks clarity, redundancy control, or structural thoroughness ‚Äî we will lose a $100,000+ contract and future engagements.
  So keep your **ULTRA THINK** mode ON while planning.
  Return only the `plan_graph` and `next_step_id` as JSON.

  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this: The user wants a comprehensive stock analysis report on Asian Paints, including charts, tables, and comparisons. Since I don't have any pre-existing knowledge about Asian Paints or access to live stock data, I need to create a discovery plan to gather the necessary information before creating the full report. This will involve retrieving information about the company, its financials, its competitors, and the relevant market data. I'll start with a conservative approach, ensuring each step is well-defined and focuses on gathering specific information before moving on to analysis and report generation. I need to remember to create a plan that can be handled by a team of consultants and that's easily delegable. CoderAgent can generate charts, but FormatterAgent should be the one to polish it. I should use retriever to get data, thinker to analyze it, coder to create charts, and formatter to create a report.",

  ################################################################################################
  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data on related or unrelated topics, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},

      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('India Japan flights direct routes DEL NRT airfare', 6)\noutput = {'flights': results}"
    }
  }

    }
  }
  ### **Image Processing Query:**
  **Input:** "Extract text from uploaded image"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = caption_images('uploaded_image.jpg')\noutput = {'image_text': results}"
    }
  }

      "CODE_2": "results = search_stored_documents_rag('project management timeline dates', 6)\noutput = {'documents': results}"
    }
  }
  ### **Complex Research (Multiple Fallbacks):**
  **Input:** "Find comprehensive data on AI startups in healthcare"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('AI startups healthcare medical artificial intelligence companies 2024', 8)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('machine learning healthcare startups medical AI funding', 6)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}",
      "CODE_3": "results = search_web_with_text_content('healthcare technology artificial intelligence companies venture', 5)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}"
    }
  }
  ### **Multi-Step Search Example:**

  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **Input (Second):** "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover at Singapore"  
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "all_flight_data = previous_output.get('flight_information', [])\nlayover_flight_data = results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights with layover in Singapore', 8)\noutput = {'detailed_flights': all_flight_data + layover_flight_data}"
    }
  }
  ### **PDF + Web Search Example:**
  **Input (First):** "Research AI companies and also check uploaded reports"  
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Combine web search results with PDF content for comprehensive analysis", 
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "web_data = search_web_with_text_content('AI companies startups 2024', 6)\npdf_data = convert_pdf_to_markdown('report.pdf')\noutput = {'web_results': web_data, 'pdf_content': pdf_data}"
    }
  }
  **Input (Second):** "Combine web search results with PDF content for comprehensive analysis"

    }
  }
  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
  Before outputting:
  - [ ] Used real tool names (search_web_with_text_content, convert_pdf_to_markdown, etc.)
  - [ ] Code format is object with CODE_1, CODE_2 keys
  - [ ] Each code variant is complete and independent
  - [ ] Used search_web_with_text_content as primary tool
  - [ ] Only provided fallbacks when genuinely needed
  - [ ] Code ends with `output = {...}`
  - [ ] Use call_self=true when asked for comprehensive research or details
  - [ ] Previous output variables are accessed as per available structure
  - [ ] Final step is returning consolidated output across all iterations in a multi-step process
  **Your role**: Call tools ‚Üí Retrieve raw data ‚Üí Pass to next agent.
  Return only valid JSON with no markdown formatting.

Despite starting with a modest capital, the founders had a clear vision of becoming a leading player in the paint industry. Their entrepreneurial spirit and innovative strategies laid the foundation for what would become one of the most successful paint companies in the world. Innovation and Market Leadership Asian Paints quickly distinguished itself from competitors by focusing on innovation and customer satisfaction. In the 1950s and 60s, the company revolutionized the industry by introducing smaller pack sizes, making paint more accessible to a broader audience. This move significantly increased their market share, particularly among rural consumers who could now afford to purchase paint in smaller quantities. In the 1970s, Asian Paints continued its innovative streak by developing computer color matching technology, which allowed for a broader range of colors and more accurate mixing. This technological advancement set them apart from competitors and cemented their position as an industry leader. Commitment to Quality and Sustainability Throughout its history, Asian Paints has maintained a strong commitment to quality. The company invests heavily in research and development to ensure its products meet the highest standards.

  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data on related or unrelated topics, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**

Despite starting with a modest capital, the founders had a clear vision of becoming a leading player in the paint industry. Their entrepreneurial spirit and innovative strategies laid the foundation for what would become one of the most successful paint companies in the world. Innovation and Market Leadership Asian Paints quickly distinguished itself from competitors by focusing on innovation and customer satisfaction. In the 1950s and 60s, the company revolutionized the industry by introducing smaller pack sizes, making paint more accessible to a broader audience. This move significantly increased their market share, particularly among rural consumers who could now afford to purchase paint in smaller quantities. In the 1970s, Asian Paints continued its innovative streak by developing computer color matching technology, which allowed for a broader range of colors and more accurate mixing. This technological advancement set them apart from competitors and cemented their position as an industry leader. Commitment to Quality and Sustainability Throughout its history, Asian Paints has maintained a strong commitment to quality. The company invests heavily in research and development to ensure its products meet the highest standards. Their state-of-the-art laboratories and manufacturing facilities are equipped with the latest technology to ensure consistency and excellence in every product. Sustainability is also a core value for Asian Paints. The company has implemented various eco-friendly initiatives, such as water-based paints that reduce environmental impact and energy-efficient manufacturing processes.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ]. Market Trends and Industry Analysis The Indian paints industry is dynamic and competitive, with several factors influencing growth. Raw material price fluctuations significantly impact profitability across the board.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ].

The stock has consistently shown a robust performance, supported by strong fundamentals and market dominance. This analysis will break down Asian Paints stock price performance, financial metrics, and future predictions based on the provided data. Stock Price Movement and Technical Indicators The stock chart for Asian Paints shows the weekly price movement, including the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMA). The 50-day EMA currently stands at 3052.49, while the 200-day EMA is at 2848.22. Asian Paints is trading near its 50-day EMA at 3039.75, indicating some level of resistance at the EMA level. This suggests that the stock may face pressure around this price range, but a breakout above could signal an upward trend. The stock price has been moving within a consolidation zone, as depicted by the rectangular box. This range-bound movement highlights the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers. The support lies at 2670, while the resistance is around 3423. A decisive move beyond this range could indicate a new direction for the stock. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.51. An RSI value below 50 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, meaning there is room for upward movement if buying momentum picks up.

The current stock price is 3038.

Dividend Yield and Return on Equity (ROE) : The company offers a dividend yield of 1.10%, which is relatively modest but consistent. The return on equity (ROE) stands at an impressive 31.4%, reflecting how efficiently the company is using shareholders' funds to generate profits. The three-year average ROE is recorded at 27.8%, further proving Asian Paints strong financial management. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) : The ROCE for Asian Paints is 37.5%, a solid figure showing that the company efficiently utilises its capital to generate returns. The high ROCE highlights the companys strong profitability and operational efficiency. Pros and Cons Pros : The company has delivered consistent profit growth, with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.5% over the last five years. This makes it a strong contender for investors seeking growth stocks. Asian Paints has maintained a good ROE over the years, with a healthy dividend payout of 59.7%. This indicates that the company not only focuses on growth but also rewards its shareholders consistently. Cons : The stock is currently trading at 15.6 times its book value, indicating it might be overvalued. Investors need to exercise caution, especially if broader market conditions become unfavourable.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ]. Market Trends and Industry Analysis The Indian paints industry is dynamic and competitive, with several factors influencing growth. Raw material price fluctuations significantly impact profitability across the board.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ]. Market Trends and Industry Analysis The Indian paints industry is dynamic and competitive, with several factors influencing growth. Raw material price fluctuations significantly impact profitability across the board.

Their entrepreneurial spirit and innovative strategies laid the foundation for what would become one of the most successful paint companies in the world. Innovation and Market Leadership Asian Paints quickly distinguished itself from competitors by focusing on innovation and customer satisfaction.

This technological advancement set them apart from competitors and cemented their position as an industry leader.

The company invests heavily in research and development to ensure its products meet the highest standards. Their state-of-the-art laboratories and manufacturing facilities are equipped with the latest technology to ensure consistency and excellence in every product.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ].

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap.

A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ].

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ]. Market Trends and Industry Analysis The Indian paints industry is dynamic and competitive, with several factors influencing growth. Raw material price fluctuations significantly impact profitability across the board.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ]. Market Trends and Industry Analysis The Indian paints industry is dynamic and competitive, with several factors influencing growth. Raw material price fluctuations significantly impact profitability across the board.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ]. Market Trends and Industry Analysis The Indian paints industry is dynamic and competitive, with several factors influencing growth. Raw material price fluctuations significantly impact profitability across the board.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ].

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap.

A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ].

The stock has consistently shown a robust performance, supported by strong fundamentals and market dominance. This analysis will break down Asian Paints stock price performance, financial metrics, and future predictions based on the provided data. Stock Price Movement and Technical Indicators The stock chart for Asian Paints shows the weekly price movement, including the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMA). The 50-day EMA currently stands at 3052.49, while the 200-day EMA is at 2848.22. Asian Paints is trading near its 50-day EMA at 3039.75, indicating some level of resistance at the EMA level. This suggests that the stock may face pressure around this price range, but a breakout above could signal an upward trend. The stock price has been moving within a consolidation zone, as depicted by the rectangular box. This range-bound movement highlights the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers. The support lies at 2670, while the resistance is around 3423. A decisive move beyond this range could indicate a new direction for the stock. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.51. An RSI value below 50 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, meaning there is room for upward movement if buying momentum picks up.

Introduction Recent Financial Performance Market Trends and Industry Analysis Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Regulatory and Macro-Economic Factors Risk Factors Future Outlook Recommendations for Investors Asian Paints year-on-year Revenue Growth has lagged behind competitors like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac. Introduction Asian Paints, a titan in the Indian paints industry and a significant player globally, has recently witnessed a slowdown in its year-on-year revenue growth. This deceleration, coupled with the comparatively stronger performance of competitors such as Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, has raised concerns amongst investors and analysts. This article delves into the various factors contributing to this trend, analyzing recent Financial Performance , market dynamics, regulatory influences, and potential future scenarios for the company. We will examine the available data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian Paints current position and its prospects for regaining its market dominance. Recent Financial Performance A detailed examination of Asian Paints recent financial reports reveals a concerning trend. While precise figures require referencing specific financial statements (which are readily available on the company website and major financial news sources), the general consensus points to a slower pace of revenue growth compared to its main competitors. This underperformance isnt necessarily indicative of a complete decline, but rather a slowing of the growth trajectory. Factors such as increased input costs (raw materials, particularly titanium dioxide and crude oil derivatives), intensified competition, and potentially shifting consumer preferences have all contributed to this less-than-stellar performance. Direct comparison with Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolacs financial reports, focusing on key performance indicators like revenue growth, operating margins, and net profit margins, would provide a more robust assessment of the relative performance gap. [ Cite specific financial reports and sources here, e.g., Asian Paints Annual Report 2023, Berger Paints Q[Quarter] [Year] Results, etc. ] Furthermore, a crucial aspect to consider is the regional performance variation within Asian Paints portfolio. A deeper dive into regional sales data can uncover whether the slowdown is uniform across all markets or concentrated in specific regions, hinting at localized economic factors or competitive pressures at play. Geographic segmentation analysis is vital to understand whether particular markets are outperforming or underperforming expectations, offering a more nuanced picture beyond simple aggregate figures. [ Cite source for regional sales data if available. This might be analyst reports or supplementary information from company presentations ]. Market Trends and Industry Analysis The Indian paints industry is dynamic and competitive, with several factors influencing growth. Raw material price fluctuations significantly impact profitability across the board.

  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üéØ How to assess call_self need
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - Task requires multiple sequential steps: 
      - Search information on topics ‚Üí then retrieve more information on specific topics based on previous steps 
  - Need to process results from first tool call in a second iteration
  - Workflow has clear step 1 ‚Üí step 2 dependency
  - Task asks for "detailed" or "comprehensive" data on related or unrelated topics, which needs varied data sources like tables, images, charts etc. 
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - Single tool call can complete the entire task
  - Task is simple and atomic
  - No sequential dependencies needed
  - This is the last iteration needed to achieve the current task, in this case you must consolidate all iterations into a single output
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ** "When call_self is true ** - ALWAYS provide next_instruction when call_self is TRUE"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",

    }
  }
  ### **Complex Research (Multiple Fallbacks):**
  **Input:** "Find comprehensive data on AI startups in healthcare"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('AI startups healthcare medical artificial intelligence companies 2024', 8)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('machine learning healthcare startups medical AI funding', 6)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}",
      "CODE_3": "results = search_web_with_text_content('healthcare technology artificial intelligence companies venture', 5)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}"
    }
  }
  ### **Multi-Step Search Example:**
  **Input (First):** "Find comprehensive flight data from Delhi to Tokyo"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover in Singapore",
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights booking sites travel agencies', 8)\noutput = {'flight_information': results}"
    }
  }
  **Input (Second):** "Extract detailed flight information on flights with layover at Singapore"  
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "all_flight_data = previous_output.get('flight_information', [])\nlayover_flight_data = results = search_web_with_text_content('Delhi Tokyo flights with layover in Singapore', 8)\noutput = {'detailed_flights': all_flight_data + layover_flight_data}"
    }
  }

  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,

    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "web_data = search_web_with_text_content('AI companies startups 2024', 6)\npdf_data = convert_pdf_to_markdown('report.pdf')\noutput = {'web_results': web_data, 'pdf_content': pdf_data}"
    }
  }
  **Input (Second):** "Combine web search results with PDF content for comprehensive analysis"

    }
  }
  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output[N]['output']['execution_result']['code_results']['result']['key']`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: 
      - Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
      - If this is the final iteration, combine outputs from current and previous iterations into a single final output
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in next iteration code as per the structure available to you
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
  Before outputting:
  - [ ] Used real tool names (search_web_with_text_content, convert_pdf_to_markdown, etc.)
  - [ ] Code format is object with CODE_1, CODE_2 keys
  - [ ] Each code variant is complete and independent
  - [ ] Used search_web_with_text_content as primary tool
  - [ ] Only provided fallbacks when genuinely needed
  - [ ] Code ends with `output = {...}`
  - [ ] Use call_self=true when asked for comprehensive research or details
  - [ ] Previous output variables are accessed as per available structure
  - [ ] Final step is returning consolidated output across all iterations in a multi-step process
  **Your role**: Call tools ‚Üí Retrieve raw data ‚Üí Pass to next agent.
  Return only valid JSON with no markdown formatting.
