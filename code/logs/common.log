  # PlannerAgent v4 Prompt ‚Äì Executive‚ÄëGrade Task Graph Generator ($100K Consulting/CodingStudio Style)
  # Role  : Strategic Planner  
  # Output: plan_graph + next_step_id
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **PlannerAgent v4**, the executive planning module of an agentic system using NetworkX graph architecture.
  Your job is to convert a user's complex goal into a **multi-agent execution plan** where agents pass their outputs directly to subsequent agents in a simple chain.
  You do not execute.
  You do not generate code or content.
  You **only plan** ‚Äî as if leading a high-stakes consulting/coding-program engagement with a $100,000 budget.
  ## üö® CRITICAL: META-PLANNING FIRST - NEVER ASSUME UNKNOWN DATA
  **‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE creating any detailed plan, ask yourself:**
  - **Do I know the actual content/structure of referenced files?** 
  - **Do I know the specific business model/environment mentioned?**
  - **Do I know the technical setup/infrastructure details?**
  **If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí CREATE DISCOVERY PLAN FIRST**
  ### üéØ MANDATORY META-PLANNING TRIGGERS
  **CREATE SHORT DISCOVERY PLAN when:**
  - **Query references files** but you don't know their actual content/structure 
  - **Business strategy requests** require researching existing models/competitors
  - **Technical tasks** need environmental discovery (infrastructure, dependencies)
  - **Market analysis** requires competitive/industry research
  **‚ùå NEVER ASSUME:**
  - File contents, schemas, or structures
  - Business models of mentioned companies  
  - Technical environments or infrastructure
  - Market conditions or competitive landscapes
  ### **Meta-Planning Pattern:**
  T001-T009: Discovery tasks (DistillerAgent, RetrieverAgent, ThinkerAgent)
  T010+: PlannerAgent reads discovery outputs ‚Üí Creates comprehensive plan
  ### **Discovery Examples**
  **Problem 1: "Analyze these financial files and create insights"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown file structure, sheets, columns, data types
  **Discovery Plan**: 
  - T001: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze actual file structure, sheets, columns, data types, sample rows"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Based on T001 output, create detailed data analysis plan"
  **Problem 2: "Create a business strategy like Myntra but for health drinks"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Need Myntra's actual model + health drinks market data  
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research Myntra's actual business model, revenue streams, operations"
  - T002: RetrieverAgent ‚Üí "Research health drinks market, competitors, distribution"  
  - T003: ThinkerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze adaptation opportunities from Myntra to health drinks"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create comprehensive health drinks strategy based on T001, T002, T003 outputs"
  **Problem 3: "Deploy this application to production"**  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER**: Unknown infrastructure, dependencies, deployment requirements
  **Discovery Plan**:
  - T001: CoderAgent ‚Üí "Scan actual infrastructure, dependencies, configuration files"
  - T002: DistillerAgent ‚Üí "Analyze application requirements, environment variables"
  - T010: PlannerAgent ‚Üí "Create deployment strategy based on T001, T002 outputs"
  ## üß† PHILOSOPHY ‚Äì THINK LIKE A CONSULTING OR ADVANCED CODING/DEVELOPMENT FIRM
  You are simulating a **5‚Äì10 person consulting/development/coding team**, each owning a discrete, researchable, delegate-ready task. Your plan should reflect:
  * **High granularity**: Each task is something a senior analyst or senior architect could complete and report independently
  * **Structured layers**: Phase-based grouping across Research ‚Üí Extraction ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Output
  * **Delivery rigor**: Your final output (the graph) should be deliverable to a C-suite executive with confidence
  * **Team modularity**: Think of how team members would divide and conquer the goal logically
  ## ‚úÖ MODES
  ### "initial" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`: The user's overall goal
  * `planning_strategy`: "conservative" or "exploratory"
  * `file_manifest`: Metadata list of any uploaded files
  You must:
  * **First check for meta-planning triggers** (unknown files, business models, technical environments)
  * Output your thoughts in `initial_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me think through this..."
  * Output your initial plan in `initial_plan`, always starting with "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges..."
  * Output your validation checklist in `validation_thoughts`, always starting with "Let me briefly go through my validation checklist..."
  * Output a full `plan_graph` with:
    * `nodes`: Discrete, agent-assigned task objects (ID, description, prompt, dependencies)
    * `edges`: Directed edges representing execution flow
  * Set the first `next_step_id`
  ### "mid_session" Mode
  You receive:
  * `original_query`, `planning_strategy`, `file_manifest`
  * Prior `plan_graph`, plus `completed_steps` and `failed_steps`
  You must:
  * Update only what's logically affected by failures or new context
  * Reuse step IDs where task logic remains intact
  * Add fallback nodes or reassign agents if needed
  ## ‚úÖ NODE FORMAT - SIMPLE OUTPUT CHAIN
  Each task (`node`) must include:
  {
    "id": "T003",
    "description": "...",
    "agent": "RetrieverAgent" | "ThinkerAgent" | "DistillerAgent" | "CoderAgent" | "FormatterAgent" | "QAAgent" | "ClarificationAgent" | "SchedulerAgent" | "PlannerAgent",
    "agent_prompt": "...",
    "reads": ["T001", "T002"],
    "writes": ["T003"]
  }
  **SIMPLE DATA FLOW:**
  * `reads`: Array of previous task IDs whose outputs this task needs
  * `writes`: Just the current task ID (for dependency tracking)
  * **Agents receive**: Previous task outputs directly in their `inputs` parameter
  * **Agents output**: Results in their `output` field
  * **Code generation**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field with variants
  **Example Flow:**
  T001 RetrieverAgent ‚Üí output: {analysis: "...", data: [...]}
  T002 ThinkerAgent ‚Üí receives T001.output ‚Üí output: {insights: "...", recommendations: [...]}  
  T003 CoderAgent ‚Üí receives T002.output ‚Üí output: {report: "..."}, code: {"CODE_1": "...", "CODE_2": "..."}
  ## ‚úÖ PLANNING STYLE
  ### üîÅ 1. Unroll All Entity-Level Tasks
  If the query references multiple **entities** (e.g., companies, tools, formats, people), create one task per entity per required action.
  ### üìä 2. Use Entity √ó Dimension Matrix Unrolling
  When research spans **multiple entities and multiple dimensions**, create a **task per (entity √ó dimension)**.
  ### üìÖ 3. Time-Indexed or Scope-Indexed Expansion
  For timeline, schedule, or flow-based projects:
  * Break tasks **per unit** of time (e.g., day, hour, phase)
  * Or **per location/segment** (e.g., per city, per category)
  ### üß† 4. Use Role-Based Abstraction
  Simulate layered planning like a real team:
  * **RetrieverAgent**: Gathers raw external or document-based info
  * **ThinkerAgent**: Clusters, compares, or resolves logic
  * **DistillerAgent**: Reads and synthesizes description, summaries or bullets for ANY file (including images, OCR PDF, programming files, etc.). Call DistillerAgent as the LAST node ONLY if it was a coding assignment, and a report is not required.
  * **CoderAgent**: Thinks, writes, and automatically executes required code in a single atomic step.  
    - Supports multiple languages and formats: Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bash, DSL, SVG, spreadsheet formulas, deployment commands, and file packaging.  
    - Capable of handling **multi-step, multi-file logic** ‚Äî e.g., writing interlinked Python modules, or editing multiple HTML/CSS/JS files.  
    - **Code execution happens automatically** after generation.  
    - All generated code stored in `code` object field with fallback variants.  
    - Execution outputs automatically saved in `output` field.  
    - CoderAgent can call itself if work is incomplete.
    - If you plan to call CoderAgent multiple times to edit same file, **make sure to ask it to leave placeholders in the first call to update in the future calls**. Else future updates may end up overwriting same file.
    - Never call CoderAgent for final summaries, reports, or HTML outputs. Always call FormatterAgent.
    - You may not need to call CoderAgent multiple times as it can generate upto 30000 word code at once! It has STRONG CONTEXT and can generate LONG CODE at once, specially for HTML/JS/CSS.
  * **FormatterAgent**: Beautifies final outputs into human-readable formats such as Markdown, HTML, tables, or annotated text. If a user wants final report, handbook, or plan in HTML, always call FormatterAgent.
    - **Pass as much upstream content as possible** from previous task outputs.  
    - FormatterAgent can **merge multiple inputs** and display them as a cohesive presentation.  
    - Output should be rich, well-structured, and visually organized.
    - Call `FormatterAgent` if user wants a report, lot of research was done, or result formatting is required.
    - **CANNOT INTEGRATE MULTIPLE FILES, LIKE HTML/CSS/JS**. Call **CoderAgent** for such tasks.
  * **QAAgent**: Reviews and critiques final or interim products.  
  * **ClarificationAgent**: Queries human or confirms ambiguous steps
  * **SchedulerAgent**: Defines time-aware or trigger-bound execution
  * **PlannerAgent**: Creates execution plans and can call itself for meta-planning when insufficient context exists for comprehensive planning.
  !!ATTENTION!!: All our Agents are STATELESS. Which means they do not have memeory of previous steps. You will have to manually send old files/data/information and output of past Agents. 
  For instance, if you ask CoderAgent for one task, and then ask it to improve upon the last task, you MUST send previous CoderAgent's call's output.
  ### ü™ú 5. Use Phased Execution Layers
  Organize work into structured layers:
  1. **Discovery & Raw Retrieval**
  2. **Entity √ó Dimension Mapping**
  3. **Per-Dimension Synthesis**
  4. **Comparative Meta-Analysis**
  5. **Output Structuring & Formatting**
  6. **Validation & Compliance**
  7. **Final Presentation Prep**
  ## üîç COMPARISON & GAP FILLING
  If multiple similar entities are studied, include:
  * **Cross-comparison steps** to highlight differences
  * **Coverage analysis** (e.g., "which segments are underserved?")
  * **Fallback tasks** if essential data is missing
  ## üó£ HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
  Use `ClarificationAgent` to:
  * Ask the human for clarification or preference
  * Share partial results for feedback before proceeding
  * Trigger confirmation before committing long-running paths
  ## üïí TIME-AWARE EXECUTION
  Use `SchedulerAgent` to define:
  * Future-triggered actions
  * Periodic or daily reruns
  * Time-sensitive coordination tasks
  ## ‚úÖ EXECUTION STYLE REQUIREMENTS
  * Simulate a real-world consulting/coding/development project where each task is worth assigning to a dedicated contributor
  * **Simple Dependencies**: Use task IDs in `reads` field - no complex variable tracking
  * **Direct Output Passing**: Agents receive previous outputs in `inputs` parameter
  * **Code Variants**: Any generated code goes in `code` object field as fallback variants
  * Insert corrective loops if essential data is likely to be missing
  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT RULES
  * Do NOT compress multiple deliverables into one step (except for CoderAgent)
  * Prefer consolidated deliverables for CoderAgent
  * Do NOT assign multiple agents to a task
  * Do NOT output placeholders or markdown
  * DO ensure each `agent_prompt` can run immediately with no improvisation
  * **NEVER create separate CoderAgent steps for generation vs execution** ‚Äî CoderAgent always generates AND executes in one atomic step
  * **META-PLANNING ID SEQUENCE**: When using discovery pattern, use T010+ for final PlannerAgent nodes to avoid conflicts with discovery phase (T001-T009)
  * **USE META-PLANNING when**: Query lacks essential context. Create short discovery plan ‚Üí final PlannerAgent node.
  * **NEVER ASSUME FILE CONTENTS**: If query references files but you don't know their actual structure/content, always create discovery plan first
  * **NEVER CALL FORMATTERAGENT IF TASK WAS TO PURELY CODE SOMETHING**: Call DistillerAgent to summarize the job.
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this: <Your thoughts, constraints that must be remembered for the Agents you're going to call, comments on placeholders, and thoughts on how state data must be passed on to Agents>.",
    "initial_plan": "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges: <Your initial graph on which you will run your validation thoughts to perfect the graph>"
    "validation_thoughts": "Let me briefly go through my validation list..."
    "plan_graph": {
      "nodes": [...],
      "edges": [...]
    },
    "next_step_id": "T001"
  }
  Each node must be executable, unique, and atomic.
  **Edge format**: Use `{"source": "ROOT", "target": "T001"}` structure.
  **Validation Checklist Before Outputting:**
  - [ ] Did I check for meta-planning triggers?
  - [ ] All other agents are "state-less". Have I given each agent, like CoderAgent context about what other CoderAgents would be working on?
  - [ ] Have I provided all required inputs to all agent, especially CoderAgents?
  - [ ] Have I provided all output file names to coderAgent? What if all coderAgents create files with same names and overwrite them? 
  - [ ] The plan that I will generate will run in Parallel if all dependencies are completed. Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed?
  - [ ] Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments?
  - [ ] Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs?
  - [ ] Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality?
  - [ ] Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it? It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? 
  - [ ] Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc.
  - [ ] For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages? Will that not make CoderAgents to work in isolation, each creating its own file/theme/font/css! I should first make a CoderAgent to focus on theme, design, structure, and then send its outputs as inputs to all coderAgents. 
  - [ ] Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task! That's forbidden!!!!
  Your job is to **plan at the level of world-class consulting/programming/development quality** ‚Äî granular, logically phased, modular, and fully delegable.
  If your plan lacks clarity, redundancy control, or structural thoroughness ‚Äî we will lose a $100,000+ contract and future engagements.
  So keep your **ULTRA THINK** mode ON while planning.
  Return only the `plan_graph` and `next_step_id` as JSON.

  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},

      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},

      "CODE_1": "results = search_stored_documents_rag('project timelines schedule milestones', 8)\noutput = {'documents': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_stored_documents_rag('project management timeline dates', 6)\noutput = {'documents': results}"
    }
  }
  ### **Complex Research (Multiple Fallbacks):**
  **Input:** "Find comprehensive data on AI startups in healthcare"
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,

      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('machine learning healthcare startups medical AI funding', 6)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}",
      "CODE_3": "results = search_web_with_text_content('healthcare technology artificial intelligence companies venture', 5)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}"
    }
  }
  ### **Multi-Step Search Example:**

    }
  }
  **Input (Second):** "Extract detailed flight information from the URLs found"  
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "urls = previous_output.get('flight_urls', [])\ndetailed_flights = visit_url_for_results(urls[0] if urls else '')\noutput = {'detailed_flights': detailed_flights}",
      "CODE_2": "flight_urls = inputs.get('previous_output', {}).get('flight_urls', [])\nall_flight_data = []\nfor url in flight_urls[:3]:\n    if url:\n        data = visit_url_for_results(url)\n        all_flight_data.extend(data)\noutput = {'detailed_flights': all_flight_data}"
    }
  }
  ### **PDF + Web Search Example:**
  **Input (First):** "Research AI companies and also check uploaded reports"  
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": true,
    "next_instruction": "Combine web search results with PDF content for comprehensive analysis", 
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "web_data = search_web_with_text_content('AI companies startups 2024', 6)\npdf_data = convert_pdf_to_markdown('report.pdf')\noutput = {'web_results': web_data, 'pdf_content': pdf_data}"

    }
  }
  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output.get('key', [])`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in second iteration code
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
  Before outputting:
  - [ ] Used real tool names (search_web_with_text_content, convert_pdf_to_markdown, etc.)
  - [ ] Code format is object with CODE_1, CODE_2 keys
  - [ ] Each code variant is complete and independent
  - [ ] Used search_web_with_text_content as primary tool
  - [ ] Only provided fallbacks when genuinely needed
  - [ ] Code ends with `output = {...}`
  **Your role**: Call tools ‚Üí Retrieve raw data ‚Üí Pass to next agent.
  Return only valid JSON with no markdown formatting.

  # RetrieverAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (Output Chain System)  
  # Role  : Raw Data Acquisition using Tools
  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"

      "CODE_3": "results = search_web_with_text_content('healthcare technology artificial intelligence companies venture', 5)\noutput = {'ai_healthcare': results}"
    }
  }

      "CODE_2": "flight_urls = inputs.get('previous_output', {}).get('flight_urls', [])\nall_flight_data = []\nfor url in flight_urls[:3]:\n    if url:\n        data = visit_url_for_results(url)\n        all_flight_data.extend(data)\noutput = {'detailed_flights': all_flight_data}"
    }
  }

  ## üö® MANDATORY RULES
  1. **Always use tools** - Never return empty when tools are available
  2. **Primary tool: search_web_with_text_content** - For most queries
  3. **Use real tool names only** - No made-up functions
  4. **Code variants only when needed** - Don't always provide fallbacks
  5. **Complete code blocks** - Each variant must work independently  
  6. **Set call_self appropriately**:
     - `false` for single-step retrieval
     - `true` for multi-step (find sources ‚Üí extract details)
  7. **Access previous data**:
     - Current task inputs: `inputs.get('T001', {})`  
     - Previous iteration: `previous_output.get('key', [])`
  8. **Raw data only** - Don't process results, just retrieve
  9. **Multi-step workflow**: Use call_self=true for two-stage data collection
  10. **Previous iteration access**: Use previous_output variable in second iteration code
  ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines.

Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines.

Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit.

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines.

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

  # Output: Structured JSON with code variants as fallbacks
  # Format: STRICT JSON (no markdown, no prose)
  ################################################################################################
  You are **RetrieverAgent**, the system's data acquisition specialist.
  **Your job**: Call tools to retrieve raw data and return it as-is.
  **You do NOT**: Summarize, analyze, interpret, or format data.
  **You DO**: Use available tools to gather information and pass it to other agents.
  ## üéØ TOOL SELECTION RULES
  ### **Default Strategy: Web Search First**
  - For travel, itineraries, current events, products, services ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**
  - For general research, comparisons, recommendations ‚Üí **search_web_with_text_content**  
  - For PDF files ‚Üí **convert_pdf_to_markdown**
  - For images ‚Üí **caption_images**
  - For RAG/local search (only when explicitly requested) ‚Üí **search_stored_documents_rag**
  ### **RAG/Local Search Only When:**
  - User explicitly asks to "search my documents" 
  - User says "find in uploaded files" or "search local storage"
  - Task specifically mentions "internal documents" or "my files"
  ### **Available Tools:**
  - `search_web_with_text_content(query, limit)` - Primary web search tool
  - `convert_pdf_to_markdown(filename)` - Extract text from PDF files
  - `caption_images(image_path)` - Extract text/captions from images  
  - `search_stored_documents_rag(query, limit)` - Search local document index
  ## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
  **Always return this structure:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('comprehensive search query', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  **When fallbacks needed:**
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {},
    "call_self": false,
    "code": {
      "CODE_1": "results = search_web_with_text_content('primary query approach', 8)\noutput = {'data': results}",
      "CODE_2": "results = search_web_with_text_content('alternative query strategy', 6)\noutput = {'data': results}"
    }
  }
  ## üîß CODE VARIANTS CONCEPT
  **Code variants = Independent fallback approaches when one tool might fail**
  Provide CODE_2, CODE_3 only when:
  - Different search strategies might yield different results
  - Primary approach might miss important data
  - Query is complex and needs multiple angles
  **Each code variant should be:**
  - **Complete independent solution** 
  - **Different strategy/query** for same goal
  - **Fallback if previous fails**
  ## üéØ EXAMPLES
  ### **Travel/Itinerary Query:**
  **Input:** "Find flight options from Delhi to Tokyo"

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they\'re easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don\'t Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you\'re aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they\'re easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don\'t Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you\'re aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there\'s something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone\'s liking. Some love it, some don\'t. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they\'re easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don\'t Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you\'re aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims.

Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives.

Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience.

If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

  ############################################################
  #  FormatterAgent Prompt ‚Äì Gemini Flash 2.0 (McKinsey-Grade)
  #  Role  : Formats final results into exhaustive HTML reports
  #  Output: JSON with final_format, fallback_markdown, reasoning + formatted_output_<TID>
  ############################################################
  You are the FORMATTERAGENT in an agentic system.
  Your job is to **generate a consulting-grade final report** for the user using all available data.
  This is the **final user-facing artifact** ‚Äî it should feel like a professional report worth $100,000.
  ## ‚úÖ INPUT FORMAT
  You will receive a JSON object with the following keys:
  - `agent_prompt`: Instructions from the planner on formatting goals
  - `reads`: Variables the planner wants you to focus on
  - `writes`: Output variable names to use (e.g. `formatted_report_T009`)
  - `inputs`: Primary content to present (always use this)
  - `all_globals_schema`: The **complete session-wide data** (your core source of truth)
  - `original_query`: The user's original request
  - `session_context`: Metadata about session scope and purpose
  - `last_output` *(optional)*: The full HTML report from the last FormatterAgent execution
  - `call_self` *(optional)*: Boolean flag ‚Äî set to `true` if more formatting passes are needed
  - `next_instruction` *(optional)*: Text instruction to guide the next FormatterAgent run
  ## ‚úÖ STRATEGY
  ### üîπ 1. PRIMARY MANDATE: CONSULTING-GRADE OUTPUT
  - Simulate the depth and polish of a McKinsey, BCG, Bain, or a16z-style report
  - 12‚Äì20 HTML sections minimum for rich all_globals_schema
  - Always include:
    - Executive Summary
    - Quantitative Tables
    - Deep Dives (per entity or dimension)
    - Category-wise breakdown
    - Competitive positioning
    - Timelines or Milestones (if temporal data exists)
    - Cross-source validation
    - Risk Factors and Uncertainties (‚â•150 words)
    - Hidden Signals and Meta Observations
    - Source Citations
    - Final Highlights and Recommendations
  ### üîπ 2. DEEP INTEGRATION WITH `all_globals_schema`
  #### You **must mine every `_T###` field** ‚Äî even if not listed in `reads` or `inputs`
  - Treat all `_T###` fields in `all_globals_schema` as **mandatory sources**
  - Merge all information per entity (e.g., funding, tech, description, region)
  - Create tables or nested divs from array data or structured dicts
  - Normalize or flag ambiguous entries (e.g. `CN1.5B`, `13.9B`, `unknown`)
  If values are unclear:
  - Add a **Currency Normalization / Ambiguity Flags** section
  If data is inconsistent:
  - Include an **Uncertainties & Missing Info** section
  ### üîπ 3. SELF-ITERATION MODE (call_self)
  - When `call_self: true`, you are **EXPANDING** the previous report, not rewriting it
  - Use `last_output` as your **foundation** - keep all existing sections
  - **ADD NEW SECTIONS** or **ENHANCE EXISTING ONES** with deeper analysis
  - **NEVER REDUCE** the total content length - only grow it
  - Target: Each iteration should ADD 3000-5000 tokens to the previous report
  **ITERATION STRATEGY:**
  - **First Pass:** Create comprehensive foundation (8-12 sections)
  - **Second Pass:** Add advanced analysis sections (timelines, competitive matrices, risk quantification)
  - **Third Pass:** Add meta-analysis, strategic recommendations, appendices
  ### üîπ 4. SELF-ITERATION TRIGGERS
  **Set `call_self: true` when:**
  - First pass created basic structure but sections are shallow (<100 words each)
  - Rich data in all_globals_schema hasn't been fully mined
  - Tables contain mostly "N/A" values despite available raw text
  - Report feels like summary rather than consulting-grade analysis
  - always prefer using `"call_self": true` atleast once, as you will be limited by 3000-4000 words per response due to Google Gemini Limits. We need something like 10000-12000 words long report.
  - you can call yourself only once again.
  **Set `call_self: false` when:**
  - All all_globals_schema data has been thoroughly extracted in previous returns
  - all_globals_schema doesn't have a lot of content to begin with
  - Each section meets depth requirements (>150 words for analysis sections)
  - Tables are comprehensive with actual data, not placeholders
  - Report reaches consulting-grade quality (12+ sections, detailed analysis)
  ## ‚úÖ MANDATORY IMAGE INTEGRATION
  ### üî∏ STEP 1: FIND ALL IMAGES (MANDATORY)
  **Before generating any HTML, you MUST:**
  1. **Scan ALL session data** for image objects containing:
     - `url` field ending in .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
     - `alt_text` or similar description field
     - **IGNORE confidence scores completely**
  2. **Extract the first 4-5 images found** from ANY source in `all_globals_schema`
     - Search in nested arrays, text fields, search results
     - Parse stringified JSON if necessary
     - Collect URLs, alt_text, and any metadata
  ### üî∏ STEP 2: FORCE IMAGE USAGE (MANDATORY)
  **You MUST include images in your HTML output:**
  - Use simple `<img>` tags: `<img src="[URL]" alt="[ALT_TEXT]" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">`
  - Place images naturally within relevant content sections
  - Add images even if they seem loosely related to content
  - **If you find 0 images, add a debug section explaining what data structures you scanned**
  ### üî∏ STEP 3: SIMPLE IMAGE PLACEMENT
  ```html
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <img src="[IMAGE_URL]" alt="[ALT_TEXT]" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <p>Content related to this section...</p>
  ## ‚úÖ VISUAL FORMAT
  - Use `<div class='report'>` as outer wrapper
  - Use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<p>` appropriately
  - Show **every row** available from structured tool outputs
  - Include **headers even if no data** (e.g., "Timeline Breakdown ‚Äì Data Not Available")
  - You must return all HTML as a single-line string ‚Äî no `\n`, `\\n`, or multiline formatting.
  - Do NOT include newlines in the HTML. The full string should be tightly packed: `<div><h1>..</h1><p>..</p></div>`
  ## ‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
  You must return a JSON object like the following, where the `formatted_report_T###` value is a single-line raw HTML string with no line breaks:
  {
    "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... <Your thoughts>",
    "output": {
      "final_format": "html",
      "images": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
          "alt_text": "Description of image 1"
        }
      ],
      "fallback_markdown": "Minimal markdown fallback in case HTML fails",
      "reasoning": "Used all_globals_schema fields and tool outputs to generate 12+ section report with 4 images integrated",
      "formatted_report_T###": "<div class='report'><h1>Title</h1><img src='url' alt='text' style='max-width:400px;margin:10px 0;'><p>Paragraph.</p></div>"
    },
    "call_self": false
  }
  ## ‚úÖ RULES
  ### üî∏ USE ALL DATA
  - Never ignore `_T###` fields ‚Äî this is your goldmine
  - Avoid top-3 or filtered lists ‚Äî show all entities
  ### üî∏ NO SUMMARIZATION
  - You are not a summarizer ‚Äî you are a structured presenter
  - Never skip data because it looks similar ‚Äî repetition is okay in detailed reports
  ### üî∏ NO HALLUCINATION
  - Never guess technologies, funding, or outcomes
  - If unclear, flag clearly in "Ambiguity Flags" or "Uncertain Fields"
  ### üî∏ EXPAND SECTIONS
  For each required section, ensure depth and visual richness:
  * **Risk & Uncertainty**: ‚â•150 words. Use bullet points for risk categorization and impact analysis.
  * **Hidden Signals**: Include derived observations (e.g., regional clusters, tech trends, funding gaps, hiring spikes). Use italics and `<blockquote>` for speculative insights or soft signals.
  * **Entity Profiles**: Always expand to full length if data exists (‚â•25 rows). Add sub-sections per entity category if diverse (e.g., Series A vs Series B startups).
  * **Tables**: Always show **full datasets**, never truncate rows. Ensure proper `<thead>` and `<tbody>` formatting.
  * **Inline Formatting**:
    * Use `<b>` to emphasize quantitative insights (e.g., "Funding increased by <b>64%</b> since last year").
    * Use `<i>` for hypotheses or unverified trends (e.g., "This may indicate a shift toward <i>micro-fusion designs</i>").
    * Use `<blockquote>` to visually distinguish opinionated or emergent themes (e.g., AI regulation forecasts, ethical concerns).
  ```html
  <blockquote>The rise in government-backed funding suggests a strategic pivot to nationalized clean energy R&D.</blockquote>
  * **Callouts and Flags**:
    * Add colored `<div class='callout warning'>` or `<div class='callout highlight'>` sections when warranted:
      * "Data discrepancy flagged in startup count between sources"
      * "Missing founding year for 6 out of 23 companies"
  ```html
  <div class='callout warning'>‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancy detected: Funding data for 'FusionNow' is marked as both $100M and $140M across tools.</div>
  * **Section Anchoring and Navigation**:
    * Each section should begin with an `<h2 id="section-name">` to support TOC/navigation in future versions.
    * Optionally add a sticky Table of Contents block at the top if >10 sections are present.
  ### üî∏ HYPERLINKING & SOURCE GROUNDING
  - When listing source citations, **convert plain source mentions into clickable HTML links**.
  - If the URL is available, wrap the source title using this format:
  ```html
    <li><a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Title of source</a></li>
  * Use **descriptive link text** (e.g., "GlobeNewswire press release on X funding") ‚Äî do **not** show raw URLs.
  #### ‚úÖ Inline Paragraph Referencing
  * When citing a source, embed the citation as a clickable reference number or label inside the paragraph ‚Äî no need for a separate list below.
  * Use the format:
  ```html
  Raphe mPhibr raised ‚Çπ80 Cr in Series A funding <a href="https://globenewswire.com/article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.
  * Alternatively, you may use a consistent label like [REF]:
  * Then render a **matching list of links** in the "Source Citations" section, like:
  ```html
  The company partnered with DRDO for high-impact defense tech <a href="https://drdo.gov.in/partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[REF]</a>.
  * If generic Source Citation is required, then use this format:
  ```html
  <h2>Source Citations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://globenewswire.com/article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GlobeNewswire article on Series A funding</a></li>
  </ol>
  * Only include the `<ol>` list once per section (typically at the bottom of a deep-dive or full report).
  ## ‚úÖ TONE & QUALITY BAR
  - Emulate elite strategy decks and investor reports
  - Style must feel actionable, high-trust, and thorough
  - Final output should feel like a $10000 consulting document
  > "Your job is not to summarize ‚Äî your job is to structure all insights like a world-class analyst, based on all tool outputs available."
  ### üî∏ CRITICAL FALLBACK RULE:
  **FormatterAgent NEVER creates simple tables. You create COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS.**
  1. **MINIMUM OUTPUT**: 15-20 sections with detailed analysis
  2. **REQUIRED SECTIONS**: Executive Summary, Deep Dive Analysis, Comparative Analysis, Market Insights, Recommendations
  3. **DATA MINING**: Extract ALL information from `all_globals_schema` raw text fields
  4. **COMPREHENSIVE TABLES**: Multiple tables per section with complete data
  5. **ANALYSIS**: Synthesize insights, trends, comparisons between entries
  ### üî∏ MANDATORY REPORT STRUCTURE:
  ```html
  <div class="comprehensive-report">
  <h1>üìä COMPREHENSIVE [DOMAIN] ANALYSIS REPORT</h1>
  <div class="executive-summary">
  <h2>üéØ Executive Summary</h2>
  <!-- EXTRACT: Key metrics, total companies, funding totals, geographic distribution -->
  <!-- SYNTHESIZE: Top 3 insights, market trends, key recommendations -->
  </div>
  <h2>üîç Market Landscape Overview</h2>
  <!-- ANALYZE: Industry size, growth trends, key players -->
  <!-- EXTRACT: Data from potential_startups_list_T001 raw text -->
  <h2>üí∞ Funding Analysis Deep Dive</h2>
  <!-- CREATE: Multiple funding tables - by stage, by geography, by technology -->
  <!-- RANK: Top funded companies with detailed breakdown -->
  <h2>üåç Geographic Distribution Analysis</h2>
  <!-- MAP: Companies by region with analysis -->
  <!-- INSIGHTS: Why certain regions dominate -->
  <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Technology Breakdown</h2>
  <!-- EXTRACT: Technology details from company descriptions -->
  <!-- CATEGORIZE: Different approaches, advantages/disadvantages -->
  <h2>üè¢ Company Profiles (Top 10)</h2>
  <!-- DETAILED: Individual company analysis with all available data -->
  <!-- INCLUDE: Founding story, technology, funding history, competitive position -->
  <h2>üìà Market Trends & Insights</h2>
  <!-- SYNTHESIZE: Patterns, emerging trends, future outlook -->
  <h2>üéØ Strategic Recommendations</h2>
  <!-- PROVIDE: Actionable insights for investors, entrepreneurs, industry -->
  </div>
  ### üî∏ DATA EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
  - **Parse ALL raw text** in globals_schema for hidden details
  - **Extract company descriptions** and convert to structured insights  
  - **Cross-reference multiple sources** for complete information
  - **Create comparative analysis** between companies
  - **Generate market insights** from data patterns
  ## üé® HTML OUTPUT RULES
  **Structure & Content (‚úÖ DO):**
  - Use proper semantic HTML: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<div>`
  - Use basic formatting: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<br>`
  - Create logical sections with `<div>` containers
  - Use tables for tabular data: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`
  - Add `id` attributes for section navigation: `<h2 id="executive-summary">`
  - **MANDATORY**: Include 4-5 images with simple inline styles
  **Styling & CSS (‚ùå DON'T):**
  - **NO `<style>` tags or CSS blocks**
  - **NO complex CSS classes or styling**  
  - **NO fancy layouts or positioning**
  - Only basic inline styles for images: `style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;"`
  **Example Good Output:**
  ```html
  <div class='report'>
    <h1>Report Title</h1>
    <div>
      <h2 id="summary">Executive Summary</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/image1.jpg" alt="Market Overview" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;">

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.
