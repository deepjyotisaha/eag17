A Ann3marie3 From United Kingdom Booked this hotel as we had an early flight back to the UK from Haneda airport. Staff were helpful at check in, room was immaculate and very comfortable. Hotel is above a shopping centre so plenty of places to go for last minute gifts and places to eat. The hotel is walkable to terminal 3 departures and is signposted well.

We're visiting Kyoto in mid-April and are looking for recommendations for a ryokan hotel within a budget of $300$450 per night. Location is very important to us. Since this will be our first ryokan experience, would you recommend staying for one or two nights? Alternatively, would it be better to spend one night in a ryokan and the other in a regular hotel? Also, is Kyoto the best place for a ryokan experience, or would it make more sense to stay in a ryokan in Tokyo instead, where we might find a more budget-friendly option? Looking forward to your suggestionsthank you!

Re: Ryokan hotel recommendation - Kyoto vs Tokyo Feb 3, 2025, 4:42 PM Save If you want the best ryokan experience, you need to go to an onsen town, not Kyoto or Tokyo where only a few ryokans with onsen are available. See if they look good to you: https://kyoto-hatoya.jp/en https://www.uds-hotels.com/en/yuen/shinjuku/ Again, it is best to go to an onsen town such as Hakone, Kinosaki, Arima, Kusarsu, etc. Reply Report inappropriate content 1-3 of 3 replies Sorted by Oldest first Newest first 1 Browse forums All Browse by destination United States Forums Europe Forums Canada Forums Asia Forums Central America Forums Africa Forums Caribbean Forums Mexico Forums South Pacific Forums South America Forums Middle East Forums Go to forums home Beyond destination forums Air Travel Honeymoons and Romance Business Travel Train Travel Traveling With Disabilities Tripadvisor Support Solo Travel Bargain Travel Timeshares / Vacation Rentals SEE ALL Asia forums Japan forum Watch this Topic Reply to: Ryokan hotel recommendation - Kyoto vs Tokyo Your message Read our community guidelines Get notified by e-mail when a reply is posted Preview Japan forums Japan forums All forums Get answers to your questions about Japan Ask a question Recent Conversations Basing ourselves in Kyoto for 8 days?

Fuji stands out as one of the most picturesque places in the country. The best part? On clear days, its quite visible from Tokyo! If you dont want to travel outside of the capital, plenty of Tokyo spots offer beautiful views of the mountain, especially on the citys numerous observation decks. A proposal with Mt. Fuji in the background is as classy and timeless as can be. Who knows? Maybe proposing here will mean your future relationship will be as strong and stable as this great mountain! If you decided to propose in Mt Fuji, we highly recommend you to hire this photographer: Proposal Photographer Mount Fuji . His photos are outstanding as you can see below. For more tips, you can also read our full guide on how to propose in Mount Fuji ! 2. Wedded Rocks (Meoto Iwa) The name itself is already making us hear wedding bells. The Meoto Iwa site is located in Mie Prefecture in the Kansai Region, and it is truly a sight to behold. There is something so strangely beautiful and indeed, even sacred about two giant boulders at sea, connected together by a thick rope. This rope isnt any ordinary rope, either its shimenawa rope, believed to connect the spiritual and earthly realms together. These Wedded Rocks stand as a gorgeous spectacle and indeed one of the most memorable places you could begin your next chapter in life. The solemnity of the place paired with the stunning view of the rocky site will definitely make for an intimate yet powerful proposal. For that added magical touch, we recommend proposing at sunset! 3. Tokyo Tower Speaking of classics, we cant not mention Tokyo Tower. The countrys most famous and really, iconic skyscraper has borne witness to many proposals done within its premises and for good reason! The Tower offers an exhilarating view that will get you and your partners hearts pumping in no time, making for the perfect moment to pop that important question. At over 1,000 feet high, Tokyo Tower will offer you a beautiful panoramic view of the city that youd be really hard-pressed to get anywhere else. Theres nothing like gathering your courage to take a leap of faith (metaphorically, of course!) onto the next chapter of your life as you bask in this jaw-dropping view among the clouds. 4. Lake Mashu While we want to highlight those classic spots that draw dozens of proposals a year, we also want to give a shout out to the lesser-known hidden gems that would make for beautiful proposal spots as well. One of these is Lake Mashu! Located in the Akan Mashu National Park in Hokkaido, Lake Mashu is the perfect picturesque place to have your proposal. Make no mistake, Lake Mashu is no ordinary lake. In fact, its actually a crater lake formed over 7,000 years ago by a volcano! Known for being one of the clearest lakes in the world, Lake Mashu is unlike any other. This venue is especially perfect if your partner is a fan of astrology or stargazing because the night sky looks especially brilliant when reflected on the lakes surface. Sign up for one of Lake Mashus stargazing tours and find a quiet little nook around the area to ask the question! 5. Himeji Castle What better way to make your future life partner feel like royalty than proposing at Himeji Castle? Make your fairytale dreams come true by visiting this incredible historic site located in the Hyogo Prefecture. Just picture this pure white castle, a living example of the greatness of Japanese traditional architecture, located on top of a beautiful hill. To make the scene even more majestic, we suggest going during Spring so you can see the beautiful cherry blossom trees in full bloom surrounding the castle! You May Also Like : Cherry Blossom Forecast Dates in Japan Nicknamed the White Egret Castle or the White Heron Castle due to its stunning white exterior and resemblance to a majestic bird about to take flight, Himeji Castle dates back hundreds upon hundreds of years all the way to 1333. Registered as one of Japans first UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Himeji Castle should definitely be on your list. The photos dont do this glorious structure justice. And who knows? Maybe proposing here will mean your marriage will be as long-lasting as this castle! 6. The Seven Waterfalls of Kawazu If your significant other loves the great outdoors, then we definitely recommend checking out the seven waterfalls of Kawazu! Located in the Izu Peninsula, these seven glorious waterfalls raining down from the mountains vary spectacularly in height. From a whopping 30 meters (98 feet) to a petite 2-meter (6.5 feet) waterfall, these natural beauties are truly a sight to see. The seven waterfalls of Kawazu have inspired many works of literature, including the 1926 novel The Izu Dancer by Japans Nobel Prize Winner Kawabata Yasunari. Thats why youll see plenty of gorgeous statues in the area inspired by the text. Even better, this area is also known for having beautiful onsens (natural hot spring baths) that would just be the perfect place to relax in as you and your partner begin your next chapter in life together. 7. Kamogawa Riverside If your partner loves nature but wants something a little more on the quiet and understated side, then we recommend checking out the Kamogawa Riverside. Located in Kyoto, Kamogawa Riverside is basically one huge park where locals and tourists alike love to relax and spend time. The whole place becomes even lovelier at dusk when the traditional houses all light up, adding to the warm and romantic atmosphere that makes it perfect for low-key proposals. Its a quiet and peaceful area that has its own understated charm, making it a wonderful pick to ask the most important question of your life! 8. Chidorigafuchi Canal Speaking of, there really is just something so romantic about different bodies of water, huh? And of course, Japan has plenty of these kinds of places for you to choose from.

The mountain also offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere, making it a perfect spot to pop the question in a private and intimate setting. It's important to note, however, that Mount Wakakusa can be a bit of a hike to reach the summit. If you and your partner enjoy hiking and nature, then the climb can add an adventurous and exciting element to your proposal. However, if hiking isn't your thing or if your partner has any mobility issues, then you may want to consider other options. Another thing to keep in mind is that the mountain can be crowded with tourists, particularly during peak travel times.

Isuien Garden Isuien Garden in Nara, Japan is a beautiful and serene location, making it a potentially romantic spot for a proposal. The garden is known for its traditional Japanese design and is situated around a large pond with a tea house, bridges, and several beautiful structures that could serve as picturesque backdrops for a proposal. However, it is important to note that the garden can be quite crowded during peak tourist seasons, so it may not be the most intimate setting for a proposal. Additionally, the garden has opening hours, so it's important to plan the timing of the proposal accordingly. Ultimately, whether Isuien Garden is a good spot for a proposal will depend on the preferences and personalities of you and your partner.

Like Isuien Garden, however, Yoshikien Garden can also be quite busy during peak tourist seasons.

You have to ask the photographer to hide and place the camera at the centre where you and your girl can be seen. A Back Hug The Man Looking Proud Another cute pose involves the man hugging the girl from behind, while the girls hands are on top of the guy so the ring is seen in the photo. This shot allows everyone to see how happy and in love the couple is, with both smiling ear to ear and eyes closed. Forehead Kiss - A Sign of Affection A forehead kiss is also a beautiful proposal pose one that shows the intimacy and love you have for one another. Ask your partner to place his/her hand on your chest so the ring is clearly seen in the picture. Another tip is to close your eyes so the shot looks more romantic and intimate. Hands-Only Shot Let Everyone See the Ring Sometimes, the hand with the ring is enough to let everyone know your partner is getting hitched! This shot is perfect for shy couples out there who find posing on camera a bit awkward. Ask the photographer to zoom in on your hands and focus on the giant ring. Hold your partners hand gently to make the shot look romantic Scooping the Girl Up The Happiest Day for the Groom to Be Finally, you can scoop your girl up for a cute pose!

After dreaming of visiting Japan for as long as youve been together, there seems to be no better time or place to finally pop the question. While swept up in the blissful, if somewhat vague vision of your partners starry-eyed nod under the enchanting glow of Tokyo Tower, though, you realize that you have no idea where exactly to create this beautiful memory. Never fear, as we have collected the citys most romantic and non-cheesy spots for you lovebirds. Whether youre getting down on one knee or simply confessing your love to a crush, here are 10 locations to bookmark. Keep in mind that these all work year-round, not just on Valentines Day. List of Contents: Iconic Sights With Fewer Crowds Picturesque Gardens and Parks Other Memorable Spots Related Posts Iconic Sights With Fewer Crowds 1. Shiba Park Known for its stunning views of the iconic Tokyo Tower, Shiba Park is located alongside the peaceful residential neighborhood of Higashi-Azabu. It is completely free to enter, and houses Zojoji, a gorgeous Buddhist temple with strong ties to the Tokugawa clan. While the park is certainly a staple destination for tourists, it rarely feels overwhelmingly crowded, especially on weekdays. If you decide to propose here, make sure to head to the elevated Prince Shiba Park location on Google Maps rather than the street-level Shiba Park location; the former offers a cleaner view of the tower, a rose garden and a more intimate vibe. We recommend getting there right before sunset. Tokyo Tower periodically features special light-ups and color variations, so make sure to check for updates if you would rather experience its classic warm orange tones. Another spot to consider for a Tokyo Tower proposal is Sky Lounge Stellar Garden , the stunning bar at the top of The Prince Park Tower Tokyo, located within Shiba Park. The elegant lounge features an incredible view of the Tokyo skyline, especially after dark. 2. Odaiba Marine Park While there is no shortage of observatories and restaurants boasting beautiful city views, not many rival Odaibas sweeping, cinematic panorama of Tokyos skyline. An artificial island in Tokyo Bay, Odaiba is beloved for its breathtaking view of the Rainbow Bridge, calm atmosphere and glittering city lights. Coupled with a faux Statue of Liberty, Odaibas picturesque sights are somewhat reminiscent of the Manhattan skyline as seen from Brooklyn. Among the several waterfront parks on the island, we recommend Odaiba Marine Park for its ease of access and iconic sights. The promenade that leads to the park is also quite romantic at night, and perfect for strolling hand in hand with your loved one. Despite being a famous sightseeing spot for locals and tourists, the spacious nature of Odaiba ensures privacy and photo opportunities. 3. Tokyo City View in Roppongi Hills Mori Tower If you want to feel like you are in the sky while confessing your love, but dont want to deal with the harsh winds of the Shibuya Sky observation deck, Tokyo City View in Roppongi Hills Mori Tower is the place to go. Unlike Shibuya Sky, the observatory is housed indoors at the top of the building. The space features floor-to-ceiling windows, and does not see quite the level of crowds you get at Shibuya Sky. The deck is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily (last admission 9:30 p.m.) and costs 1,800 for adults (2,000 on weekends). You should reserve a time slot in advance to guarantee entrance, but typically, slots remain open on the day as well. See here for more details about entrance. Picturesque Gardens and Parks 4. Rikugien Gardens One of Tokyos most stunning traditional Japanese gardens, Rikugien exemplifies the tranquility of Edo period landscaping. Boasting a long history, it was designated as an important cultural asset and a site of exceptional beauty by the city of Tokyo in 1953. The garden is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and costs 300 to enter. Compared to some of Tokyos larger and well-trodden parks, the space retains an intimate and peaceful atmosphere. Depending on the month, the garden highlights the seasons charming flora and fauna. In February, you can enjoy the quiet beauty of pine trees, and depending on the year, blooming plum blossom trees. Rikugien is also known for its breathtaking weeping cherry tree, which typically blossoms in late March. Theres also the Meiji-era teahouse, Tsutsuji no Chaya, that is surrounded by fiery red maples in the fall. Togetsukyo, a stone bridge named after a famous waka poem, is also a gorgeous backdrop year-round. 5. Kiyosumi Gardens Located near the trendy, cafe-laden neighborhood of Kiyosumi Shirakawa, Kiyosumi Gardens showcases a glistening pond surrounded by lush greenery and distinctive rocks, referred to as meiseki . Designated as a Place of Scenic Beauty by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the garden is known for its evergreen Japanese Black pine trees and hydrangeas in the summer. In the winter, you will see peonies, camellias and plum blossoms. Kiyosumi Gardens is open between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. (last entry 4:30 p.m.) and requires a 150 entrance fee. Much like Rikugien, the space sees fewer tourists than more well-known parks, making it a good choice for those who want a private yet scenic setting. 6. Meiji Jingu Inner Garden One of Japans most visited Shinto shrines, Meiji Jingu was established in 1920 to commemorate Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. Surrounding the shrine are approximately 120,000 trees planted by volunteer citizens, forming Japans first eternal forest. Within this vast green arena, you can find Meiji Jingu Gyoen , also known as the Inner Garden. Unlike the rest of the park, the Inner Garden requires 500 to enter. However, its well worth paying the small fee due to the parks serene beauty. In particular, we recommend visiting this gem in June, when irises bloom in soft hues of purple and ivory. Commissioned by Emperor Meiji for Empress Shoken as irises were her favorite flower the garden is reminiscent of an Impressionist painting and is a lovely date spot. 7. Shinjuku Gyoen or Yoyogi Park Probably the two most famous parks in Tokyo, Shinjuku Gyoen and Yoyogi Park both offer spacious grounds, an abundance of seasonal plants and great vibes. The advantage of proposing or confessing your love in these well-trodden locations is that your partner would never suspect your motives. They will likely assume that you are just on a casual stroll. Also, because the parks are ideal for long walks, there is ample time to hype yourself up and pinpoint the perfect clearing. Of course, the disadvantage is that there are almost always going to be tourists and locals at these parks. However, during the winter months, they are more peaceful, especially on weekdays. Usually, spring and autumn tend to see the most crowds at famous parks, as people want to admire cherry blossoms and fall foliage. Shinjuku Gyoen highlights specific gardens and areas depending on the season, so make sure to do your research beforehand.
