The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely!

Review 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO review Terry Martin July 04, 2025 The Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV is now on sale with sharp pricing and excellent packaging, making a strong case against the budget Chinese brand competition. Small SUVs are big business in Australia and Indian brand Mahindra wants a piece of the action with its new 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO. The self-proclaimed 20-year-old start-up brand is better known Down Under for its tractors and hardcore 4x4 wagons and utes , but Mahindra is now aiming to draw in a younger, metropolitan crowd with the 3XO a light five-seater crossover with high equipment levels and a low starting price below $24,000. That makes the 3XO a compelling new entrant next to the fast-growing budget Chinese brands (think Chery , MG , GWM Haval ) and popular light-duty SUVs from the likes of Mazda, Toyota, Hyundai and Kia. Lets see whether the worlds largest tractor company has covered enough bases to shift your attention to its cute new contender.

In the flagship AX7L variant, the Mahindra 3XO has artificial leather upholstery and soft-touch trim on the dashboard and doors. How much does the2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? The 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO is priced at the budget end of the small SUV segment , starting from $23,990 driveaway for the entry-level AX5L. A top-spec AX7L model is also available from $26,990 driveaway, while customers who order either car before August 31, 2025, will receive a $500 discount. At these prices, Mahindras new baby light SUV, which is more like a high-riding hatchback than a towering presence on the road, is one of the cheapest on the market. For the money, you get a comprehensive array of infotainment tech and creature comforts. Headline features fitted standard across the range include a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster and centre touchscreen, the latter combining with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . A wireless smartphone charging pad is also provided. The drivers seat is height-adjustable, the windows and (foldable) exterior mirrors have electric adjustment and there are automatic functions for the headlights and windscreen wipers. The air-conditioning system has two temperature zones, rear air vents and feeds cool air into the glovebox, while the steering wheel is wrapped in leather and includes buttons for adjusting the six-speaker stereo and adaptive cruise control. Keyless entry, push-button start, an electronic park brake, a novel tyre position display and three selectable driving modes (the quirky Zip, Zap and Zoom instead of Eco, Normal and Sport) also point to the high specification for such a relatively low-priced car. For a $3000 premium, the AX7L adds a panoramic sunroof, front parking sensors, LED front fog lights, black leatherette seat upholstery (replacing black cloth in AX5L), soft-touch trim on the dashboard and doors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, 65W USB-C fast-charging (in addition to USB-A) and a premium Harman Kardon stereo with 380W amplifier, subwoofer and an extra speaker', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_226393175_793459181.coreimg.jpeg/1751606907935/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-interior-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': \"View of dashboard and driver's cockpit from rear seat of Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV\", 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_226393175.coreimg.jpeg/1751606931293/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax7l-rear-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Rear end of red Mahindra XUV 3XO parked in front of two white 3XO SUVs', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_copy_466073474.coreimg.jpeg/1751606967179/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax7l-drive-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Red Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV on beachside road with lifeguard tower behind', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_copy_copy.coreimg.jpeg/1751606990151/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax7l-console-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Overhead console with sunroof buttons in Mahindra XUV 3XO SUV', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/content/dam/racv-assets/images/images/content-hub/transport/2025-cars/mahindra/mahindra-xuv-3xo/2025-Mahindra-XUV-3XO-AX7L-side-1200x675.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Side-on view of red Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV in winery carpark', 'class': 'lazy', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,868 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 26.03-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | MX2 Pro 1.2 Petrol MT | MX3 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compact SUV designed to make a mark in the competitive Indian automotive market. It aims to offer a compelling package of style, safety, technology, and performance. This report provides a detailed analysis of its key features across several critical areas.\n\n**Engine Specifications and Performance:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO is powered by a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI turbocharged petrol engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. It offers both manual and automatic transmission options to cater to different driving preferences. While Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, real-world figures are expected to hover around 14-15 km/l. The engine is designed to provide a balance of performance and fuel efficiency, suitable for both city driving and occasional highway trips.\n\n**Safety Features:**\nSafety is a key highlight of the XUV 3XO, as evidenced by its five-star Global NCAP safety rating and the inclusion of six airbags. Additional safety features include ABS with EBD (Anti-lock Braking System with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution), electronic stability control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system. These features collectively contribute to a secure driving experience and aim to protect occupants in the event of a collision.\n\n**Technology and Infotainment:**\nThe XUV 3XO comes equipped with a 10.25-inch infotainment display and a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, providing seamless access to information and entertainment. The infotainment system supports wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing for easy smartphone integration. Other notable technology features include wireless charging, automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality, and a Harman Kardon 7-speaker audio system. Select models also offer Amazon Alexa integration through ADRENOX Connect technology, enabling voice control over certain car functions.\n\n**Exterior and Interior Design:**\nThe exterior design of the XUV 3XO is characterized by its sporty and modern aesthetic. Key design elements include chrome accents on the grille and headlamp finish, projector headlamps with LED DRLs, and diamond-cut alloy wheels. The vehicle also features roof rails and a sleek spoiler, adding to its bold presence on the road. The interior boasts a dual-tone dashboard with soft-touch materials and satin finishes. Comfort features include premium leatherette seats, a cooled glovebox with illumination, and rear AC vents. The overall design aims to create a premium and comfortable cabin environment.\n\n**Unique or Standout Features:**\nOne of the standout features of the XUV 3XO is its emphasis on safety, as demonstrated by its five-star Global NCAP rating.

The XUV 3XO also offers a generous ground clearance of 201mm, making it suitable for various driving conditions. Another unique feature is the availability of three driving modes: Zip, Zap, and Zoom, allowing drivers to customize the driving experience based on their preferences.\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO competes in the compact SUV segment against rivals such as the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Hyundai Venue, and Kia Sonet. It aims to differentiate itself through its combination of safety, technology, and design. While the Tata Nexon is known for its value proposition and the Maruti Brezza for its fuel efficiency, the XUV 3XO seeks to offer a more premium and feature-rich experience. However, some reviewers have noted that the XUV 3XO's boot space of 364 liters may be a limiting factor for some buyers.\n\n**Potential Risks and Warnings:**\nWhile the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers an impressive array of features, potential buyers should be aware of a few considerations. Some reviewers have noted that the electromagnetic button placement for operating the boot can be a bit cumbersome. Additionally, while the ARAI-certified mileage is 18.5 km/l, real-world figures may be lower. It's also important to consider that some features, such as front parking sensors and certain accessories, may come as add-ons, potentially increasing the overall cost of the vehicle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO appears to be a strong contender in the compact SUV segment, offering a compelling package of style, safety, technology, and performance. Its key features include a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, a 10.25-inch infotainment system, and a stylish exterior with LED DRLs and diamond-cut alloy wheels. However, potential buyers should carefully consider their individual needs and preferences, as well as the potential downsides mentioned above, before making a purchase decision.",

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

Review 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO review Terry Martin July 04, 2025 The Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV is now on sale with sharp pricing and excellent packaging, making a strong case against the budget Chinese brand competition. Small SUVs are big business in Australia and Indian brand Mahindra wants a piece of the action with its new 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO. The self-proclaimed 20-year-old start-up brand is better known Down Under for its tractors and hardcore 4x4 wagons and utes , but Mahindra is now aiming to draw in a younger, metropolitan crowd with the 3XO a light five-seater crossover with high equipment levels and a low starting price below $24,000. That makes the 3XO a compelling new entrant next to the fast-growing budget Chinese brands (think Chery , MG , GWM Haval ) and popular light-duty SUVs from the likes of Mazda, Toyota, Hyundai and Kia. Lets see whether the worlds largest tractor company has covered enough bases to shift your attention to its cute new contender.

In the flagship AX7L variant, the Mahindra 3XO has artificial leather upholstery and soft-touch trim on the dashboard and doors. How much does the2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? The 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO is priced at the budget end of the small SUV segment , starting from $23,990 driveaway for the entry-level AX5L. A top-spec AX7L model is also available from $26,990 driveaway, while customers who order either car before August 31, 2025, will receive a $500 discount. At these prices, Mahindras new baby light SUV, which is more like a high-riding hatchback than a towering presence on the road, is one of the cheapest on the market. For the money, you get a comprehensive array of infotainment tech and creature comforts. Headline features fitted standard across the range include a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster and centre touchscreen, the latter combining with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . A wireless smartphone charging pad is also provided. The drivers seat is height-adjustable, the windows and (foldable) exterior mirrors have electric adjustment and there are automatic functions for the headlights and windscreen wipers. The air-conditioning system has two temperature zones, rear air vents and feeds cool air into the glovebox, while the steering wheel is wrapped in leather and includes buttons for adjusting the six-speaker stereo and adaptive cruise control. Keyless entry, push-button start, an electronic park brake, a novel tyre position display and three selectable driving modes (the quirky Zip, Zap and Zoom instead of Eco, Normal and Sport) also point to the high specification for such a relatively low-priced car. For a $3000 premium, the AX7L adds a panoramic sunroof, front parking sensors, LED front fog lights, black leatherette seat upholstery (replacing black cloth in AX5L), soft-touch trim on the dashboard and doors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, 65W USB-C fast-charging (in addition to USB-A) and a premium Harman Kardon stereo with 380W amplifier, subwoofer and an extra speaker', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_226393175_793459181.coreimg.jpeg/1751606907935/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-interior-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': \"View of dashboard and driver's cockpit from rear seat of Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV\", 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_226393175.coreimg.jpeg/1751606931293/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax7l-rear-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Rear end of red Mahindra XUV 3XO parked in front of two white 3XO SUVs', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_copy_466073474.coreimg.jpeg/1751606967179/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax7l-drive-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Red Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV on beachside road with lifeguard tower behind', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/car-reviews/mahindra/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review/_jcr_content/root/container/articlepagecontent/content/image_copy_copy_copy.coreimg.jpeg/1751606990151/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax7l-console-1200x675.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Overhead console with sunroof buttons in Mahindra XUV 3XO SUV', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'class': 'cmp-image__image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.racv.com.au/content/dam/racv-assets/images/images/content-hub/transport/2025-cars/mahindra/mahindra-xuv-3xo/2025-Mahindra-XUV-3XO-AX7L-side-1200x675.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Side-on view of red Mahindra XUV 3XO small SUV in winery carpark', 'class': 'lazy', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,868 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 26.03-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | MX2 Pro 1.2 Petrol MT | MX3 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compact SUV designed to make a mark in the competitive Indian automotive market. It aims to offer a compelling package of style, safety, technology, and performance. This report provides a detailed analysis of its key features across several critical areas.\n\n**Engine Specifications and Performance:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO is powered by a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI turbocharged petrol engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. It offers both manual and automatic transmission options to cater to different driving preferences. While Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, real-world figures are expected to hover around 14-15 km/l. The engine is designed to provide a balance of performance and fuel efficiency, suitable for both city driving and occasional highway trips.\n\n**Safety Features:**\nSafety is a key highlight of the XUV 3XO, as evidenced by its five-star Global NCAP safety rating and the inclusion of six airbags. Additional safety features include ABS with EBD (Anti-lock Braking System with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution), electronic stability control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system. These features collectively contribute to a secure driving experience and aim to protect occupants in the event of a collision.\n\n**Technology and Infotainment:**\nThe XUV 3XO comes equipped with a 10.25-inch infotainment display and a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, providing seamless access to information and entertainment. The infotainment system supports wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing for easy smartphone integration. Other notable technology features include wireless charging, automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality, and a Harman Kardon 7-speaker audio system. Select models also offer Amazon Alexa integration through ADRENOX Connect technology, enabling voice control over certain car functions.\n\n**Exterior and Interior Design:**\nThe exterior design of the XUV 3XO is characterized by its sporty and modern aesthetic. Key design elements include chrome accents on the grille and headlamp finish, projector headlamps with LED DRLs, and diamond-cut alloy wheels. The vehicle also features roof rails and a sleek spoiler, adding to its bold presence on the road. The interior boasts a dual-tone dashboard with soft-touch materials and satin finishes. Comfort features include premium leatherette seats, a cooled glovebox with illumination, and rear AC vents. The overall design aims to create a premium and comfortable cabin environment.\n\n**Unique or Standout Features:**\nOne of the standout features of the XUV 3XO is its emphasis on safety, as demonstrated by its five-star Global NCAP rating. The inclusion of advanced technology features like the 10.25-inch infotainment system and digital instrument cluster also sets it apart from some competitors. The XUV 3XO also offers a generous ground clearance of 201mm, making it suitable for various driving conditions. Another unique feature is the availability of three driving modes: Zip, Zap, and Zoom, allowing drivers to customize the driving experience based on their preferences.\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO competes in the compact SUV segment against rivals such as the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Hyundai Venue, and Kia Sonet. It aims to differentiate itself through its combination of safety, technology, and design. While the Tata Nexon is known for its value proposition and the Maruti Brezza for its fuel efficiency, the XUV 3XO seeks to offer a more premium and feature-rich experience. However, some reviewers have noted that the XUV 3XO's boot space of 364 liters may be a limiting factor for some buyers.\n\n**Potential Risks and Warnings:**\nWhile the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers an impressive array of features, potential buyers should be aware of a few considerations. Some reviewers have noted that the electromagnetic button placement for operating the boot can be a bit cumbersome. Additionally, while the ARAI-certified mileage is 18.5 km/l, real-world figures may be lower. It's also important to consider that some features, such as front parking sensors and certain accessories, may come as add-ons, potentially increasing the overall cost of the vehicle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO appears to be a strong contender in the compact SUV segment, offering a compelling package of style, safety, technology, and performance. Its key features include a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, a 10.25-inch infotainment system, and a stylish exterior with LED DRLs and diamond-cut alloy wheels. However, potential buyers should carefully consider their individual needs and preferences, as well as the potential downsides mentioned above, before making a purchase decision.",
