Therefore, the following feature list is based on my general knowledge of Mahindra vehicles and standard automotive features found in the subcompact SUV segment. Please note that this list may not be entirely accurate and should be verified with official Mahindra sources once the data retrieval issue is resolved.\n\n**Engine and Performance:**\nBased on other Mahindra vehicles and market trends, the XUV 3XO is likely to offer a range of engine options, including:\n*   Petrol Engine: A turbocharged petrol engine, possibly a 1.2-liter or 1.5-liter variant, producing around 110-130 horsepower. Expect decent fuel efficiency and responsiveness.\n*   Diesel Engine: A diesel engine, possibly a 1.5-liter unit, producing around 115-120 horsepower. This would offer better fuel economy for long-distance driving.\n*   Transmission: Both manual and automatic transmission options are likely to be available, including a possible torque converter automatic or an AMT (Automated Manual Transmission) for better fuel efficiency. Drive modes (Eco, Normal, Sport) might also be present.\n\n**Safety:**\nSafety features are increasingly important, and the XUV 3XO would likely include:\n*   Airbags: Dual front airbags as standard, with higher trims possibly offering side and curtain airbags.\n*   ABS with EBD: Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) for enhanced braking performance and stability.\n*   Rear Parking Sensors and Camera: To aid in parking and maneuvering in tight spaces.\n*   Electronic Stability Control (ESC): To prevent skidding and loss of control.\n*   ISOFIX Child Seat Mounts: For secure installation of child seats.\n*   Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS): Higher trims might offer features like autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control.\n\n**Interior:**\nExpect a modern and comfortable interior with features like:\n*   Infotainment System: A touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Screen size likely to be 7-10 inches.\n*   Climate Control: Automatic climate control in higher trims, with manual AC in lower trims.\n*   Steering Wheel Controls: For audio, phone, and cruise control.\n*   Power Windows and Mirrors: Standard across all trims.\n*   Fabric or Leatherette Upholstery: Depending on the trim level.\n*   Adjustable Driver Seat: For optimal driving position.\n\n**Technology:**\nTech features could include:\n*   Connected Car Technology: Mahindra's Blue Sense connectivity platform for remote vehicle monitoring, geofencing, and other connected features.\n*   Digital Instrument Cluster: A semi-digital or fully digital instrument cluster to display vehicle information.\n*   Keyless Entry and Start: Push-button start and keyless entry for convenience.\n*   Wireless Charging: For smartphones in higher trims.\n*   Sunroof: A sunroof or panoramic sunroof might be offered in higher trims.\n\n**Exterior Design:**\nThe XUV 3XO will likely feature a bold and modern design with:\n*   Signature Mahindra Grille: A prominent front grille with the Mahindra logo.\n*   LED Headlamps and Tail Lamps: For enhanced visibility and aesthetics.\n*   Alloy Wheels: Stylish alloy wheels in various designs depending on the trim level.\n*   Roof Rails: Functional roof rails for carrying luggage.\n*   Bold Wheel Arches: To give the vehicle a muscular appearance.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This feature list is speculative and based on general automotive knowledge.
