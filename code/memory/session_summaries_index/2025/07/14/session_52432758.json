In the front, the upper grille is now a closed unit with glossy black finish. It comes embedded with six vertical slots and the twin peak Mahindra logo. Also, the headlamp units now come with bi-functional LED projector and C-shaped edge mounted vertical LED DRLs. The rear of the vehicle has also been updated with a full width connected LED light bar, new bumper with reflectors and silver colour skid plate like finish at the very bottom. The side profile of the compact SUV remains more or less the same as the pre-facelift XUV300. The only difference in the side profile is the new larger 17 inch dual tone alloys and the thicker cladding all around. Interior & Features Coming to the dashboard, door trims and the overall cabin, the XUV 3XO now feels more premium because of the use of soft touch materials on the upper dashboard and door trims.
