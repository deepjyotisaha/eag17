As the latest addition to Mahindras popular XUV range, the XUV 3XO combines style, comfort, performance, safety, and technology. In this detailed blog post, we will explore the key exterior and interior design elements of the XUV 3XO and how Mahindra has crafted an SUV that makes a strong visual impact. An Exterior that Demands Attention One look at the new XUV 3XO is all it takes to notice how dramatically styled this SUV is. The front, sides and rear reflect a sense of dynamism that appeals to young and young-at-heart buyers. Some of the standout exterior highlights include: A Bold & Distinctive Face The XUV 3XOs front fascia features a wide, imposing grille with distinct chrome inserts and the signature Mahindra twin peaks logo. This immediately gives it a bold SUV character. The grille seamlessly integrates with the slim headlamps that extend towards the wheel arches, giving a frowning look. The eye-shaped bi-LED projector headlamps with integrated LED daytime running lamps are added to the dramatic front styling. With chrome bezels, these headlamps have a high-tech look and also deliver powerful illumination. Further amping up the visual drama are niceties like the skid plate with silver accents dominating the lower bumper. The round fog lamps integrated into the skid plate amplify the front presence. Sculpted Profile Exuding Power In profile, the XUV 3XO maintains a muscular and athletic form. The flared wheel arches with cladding grab attention, while the pronounced shoulder line adds to the sculpted appeal. The 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels fill up the arches well, while the raised stance lends the XUV 3XO a towering road presence. Body-coloured ORVMs blend neatly into the design. Customers can also opt for a contrast roof and ORVM colours for a bi-tone effect. The window line rises dynamically towards the rear, while the rear haunch is well-defined. Subtle creases on the lower portion of doors make the silhouette more intriguing. Sleek & Modern Rear Profile The rear of the XUV 3XO continues to surprise with its contemporary design. It features a pair of LED tail lamps that extend onto the tailgate and have a three-dimensional effect. These graphic-rich tail lamps also incorporate neat LED turn signals. The tailgate has clean surfacing, while the chrome applique and model badging add premium touches. Adding some muscle are the dual exhaust pipes integrated into the black rear skid plate. The roof-mounted spoiler with an integrated high-mount stop lamp rounds off the rear nicely. A Cabin Exuding Warmth & Luxury Stepping inside the XUV 3XO gives you the same feeling as entering a plush lounge. The cabin prioritises comfort without compromising on the premium quotient. Some talking points of the well-appointed interior include: Premium Styling & Materials The XUV 3XO greets occupants with a classy dual-tone cabin featuring a black & beige colour theme. Premium leatherette door trims with stitching details instantly catch the eye. The leatherette seats come in the same colour scheme, feel supple, and provide snug support. Ambient lighting elevates the cabins sense of occasion, especially for night travel. Ergonomic & Functional Layout Despite modern styling and premium materials, the XUV 3XO retains Mahindras focus on practicality & ease of use. Controls fall easily at hand, while the uncluttered centre console offers storage solutions like a cooled glove box. The infotainment system with Apple CarPlay & Android Auto is in prime position.

That said, it continues with black body cladding on the wheel arches and doors. The roof, roof rails and A-, B-, and C-pillar are finished in black too to gel along with the overall theme. Rear At the rear, it gets the same connected LED tail lights and a black bumper with reflectors and silver skid plate. Whats different is that the new variant gets a REVX badge on the right side of the tailgate. Interior Both the standard and REVX variants of the XUV 3XO comes with the same black / white dashboard. That said, t he white leatherette seat upholstery of the regular variants have been changed to black in the REVX variants.

As the latest addition to Mahindras popular XUV range, the XUV 3XO combines style, comfort, performance, safety, and technology. In this detailed blog post, we will explore the key exterior and interior design elements of the XUV 3XO and how Mahindra has crafted an SUV that makes a strong visual impact. An Exterior that Demands Attention One look at the new XUV 3XO is all it takes to notice how dramatically styled this SUV is. The front, sides and rear reflect a sense of dynamism that appeals to young and young-at-heart buyers. Some of the standout exterior highlights include: A Bold & Distinctive Face The XUV 3XOs front fascia features a wide, imposing grille with distinct chrome inserts and the signature Mahindra twin peaks logo. This immediately gives it a bold SUV character. The grille seamlessly integrates with the slim headlamps that extend towards the wheel arches, giving a frowning look. The eye-shaped bi-LED projector headlamps with integrated LED daytime running lamps are added to the dramatic front styling. With chrome bezels, these headlamps have a high-tech look and also deliver powerful illumination. Further amping up the visual drama are niceties like the skid plate with silver accents dominating the lower bumper. The round fog lamps integrated into the skid plate amplify the front presence. Sculpted Profile Exuding Power In profile, the XUV 3XO maintains a muscular and athletic form. The flared wheel arches with cladding grab attention, while the pronounced shoulder line adds to the sculpted appeal. The 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels fill up the arches well, while the raised stance lends the XUV 3XO a towering road presence. Body-coloured ORVMs blend neatly into the design. Customers can also opt for a contrast roof and ORVM colours for a bi-tone effect. The window line rises dynamically towards the rear, while the rear haunch is well-defined. Subtle creases on the lower portion of doors make the silhouette more intriguing. Sleek & Modern Rear Profile The rear of the XUV 3XO continues to surprise with its contemporary design. It features a pair of LED tail lamps that extend onto the tailgate and have a three-dimensional effect. These graphic-rich tail lamps also incorporate neat LED turn signals. The tailgate has clean surfacing, while the chrome applique and model badging add premium touches. Adding some muscle are the dual exhaust pipes integrated into the black rear skid plate. The roof-mounted spoiler with an integrated high-mount stop lamp rounds off the rear nicely. A Cabin Exuding Warmth & Luxury Stepping inside the XUV 3XO gives you the same feeling as entering a plush lounge. The cabin prioritises comfort without compromising on the premium quotient. Some talking points of the well-appointed interior include: Premium Styling & Materials The XUV 3XO greets occupants with a classy dual-tone cabin featuring a black & beige colour theme. Premium leatherette door trims with stitching details instantly catch the eye. The leatherette seats come in the same colour scheme, feel supple, and provide snug support. Ambient lighting elevates the cabins sense of occasion, especially for night travel. Ergonomic & Functional Layout Despite modern styling and premium materials, the XUV 3XO retains Mahindras focus on practicality & ease of use. Controls fall easily at hand, while the uncluttered centre console offers storage solutions like a cooled glove box. The infotainment system with Apple CarPlay & Android Auto is in prime position.

The XUV 3XO secured this accolade for both adult and child occupant protection, underlining Mahindras focus on providing world-class safety features in its vehicles. This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions. However, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings of adequate to marginal due to the impact forces recorded during the collision. Despite these minor deductions, protection to the driver's head, hip, and thigh was rated as good, reinforcing the XUV 3XOs overall structural integrity and crashworthiness. The XUV 3XO excelled in the side barrier and pole impact tests, securing a full 16 out of 16 points . These tests assess the SUVs ability to protect front-seat occupants in scenarios where side impacts pose a significant threat. Mahindras engineering expertise was evident, as the SUV delivered comprehensive protection to the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showcasing its robust design and stringent safety standards. In terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO also performed admirably, earning a total score of 43 out of 49 . While the SUV dropped a few points in the vehicle assessment score, it still received full marks in both the dynamic crash test and the child restraint system (CRS) parameters. The test evaluated the ability of child restraint systems to effectively secure young passengers during high-impact situations. The XUV 3XO accommodated CRS installations with ease, ensuring full protection for child passengers. Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level. The XUV 3XOs impressive safety performance is backed by a comprehensive suite of standard safety features. The SUV comes equipped with six airbags as a standard offering across all trims, ensuring superior protection for all occupants. Additionally, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) are standard, enhancing the vehicles stability and control in various driving conditions. Seat belt reminders are also provided for all seating positions, encouraging passengers to use seat belts at all times and thereby boosting overall safety. For customers opting for the higher-end variants, Mahindra offers Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) . This package includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking, adding another layer of safety and convenience for drivers. These technologies are designed to mitigate the risk of collisions and assist drivers in maintaining optimal control over the vehicle. The XUV 3XOs success in the Bharat NCAP crash tests is a testament to Mahindras dedication to vehicle safety.

This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection.

On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?
