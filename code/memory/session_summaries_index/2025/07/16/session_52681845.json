Addressing the previous timeout issue and incorporating error handling to ensure reliable data retrieval. A data validation step has also been included to ensure accuracy.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The initial attempt to gather information on recent Mahindra car launches resulted in a timeout error, indicating a need for a more targeted search approach. Building on the previous analysis, the search strategy has been refined into smaller, more specific queries to reduce the risk of timeout errors and improve the accuracy and reliability of the data retrieved. The implementation involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Searches for Recent Launches:**\n\n    *   Query 1: 'Mahindra car launches 2023'\n    *   Query 2: 'Mahindra car launches 2024'\n\n    These queries will identify specific models that have been launched in the past two years. The search results will be parsed to extract model names and any available specifications or features.\n\n2.  **Model-Specific Searches:**\n\n    Once specific models are identified, subsequent searches will be performed to gather detailed technical specifications and pricing information for each model.\n\n    *   Query 3: 'Mahindra [Model Name] specifications'\n    *   Query 4: 'Mahindra [Model Name] price in India'\n\n    For example, if the initial searches identify the 'Mahindra XUV700' and 'Mahindra Scorpio N' as relevant models, the subsequent searches would be:\n\n    *   'Mahindra XUV700 specifications'\n    *   'Mahindra XUV700 price in India'\n    *   'Mahindra Scorpio N specifications'\n    *   'Mahindra Scorpio N price in India'\n\n3.  **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**\n\n    Given the previous timeout error, it is essential to implement robust error handling. The code will include mechanisms to detect and handle timeout errors gracefully. If a timeout occurs, the agent will retry the query after a short delay (e.g., 5 seconds). This can be achieved using try-except blocks in the code. The number of retries will be limited to prevent infinite loops.\n\n4.  **Logging Search Query Results:**\n\n    To aid in debugging and diagnosing any issues, the results of each search query will be logged. This includes the query terms, the search results (URLs and snippets), and any errors encountered. The logs will be stored in a file with timestamps for easy analysis. The logs should be detailed enough to understand the full context of the search. This will help pinpoint issues and aid in refining the search queries or error handling mechanisms.\n\n5.  **Data Extraction and Consolidation:**\n\n    The search results will be parsed to extract relevant information, such as model names, specifications, features, pricing, and launch dates. This data will be consolidated into a structured format (e.g., a dictionary or a pandas DataFrame) for further analysis and recommendation. The extraction logic must be robust enough to handle variations in website layouts and formats. Regular expressions and HTML parsing libraries can be used to extract the relevant data elements.\n\n6.  **Data Verification:**\n\n    To ensure accuracy, the extracted data will be verified against multiple sources. This involves comparing the information from different websites and looking for consistent data. Any discrepancies will be flagged for manual review. This is crucial to avoid providing the user with incorrect or misleading information. Data verification should include cross-referencing specifications, features, and prices from multiple sources. The agent will identify any major inconsistencies and generate a report detailing them.\n\n7.  **Handling Empty Results:**\n\n    The agent must handle cases where the search queries return empty results. This could happen if a particular model is not launched in a specific year or if the information is not available online. The agent should log these instances and attempt alternative search queries or data sources. The agent should also flag these cases to be reviewed manually to determine if any information is available through alternative channels.\n\n8.  **Recommendation Generation:**\n\n    Based on the consolidated and verified data, the agent will generate a recommendation for the user. This will involve considering factors such as features, price, value proposition, target audience, and user preferences. The recommendation will be presented in a clear and concise format, highlighting the key benefits of the recommended model. The recommendation should include a rationale explaining why the specific model is being recommended based on the user's requirements.\n\n9.  **Features to collect for each model**\n\n*   Launch Date\n*   Trim Levels\n*   Available Features (Safety, Technology, Comfort)\n*   Technical Specifications (Engine, Transmission, Dimensions)\n*   Pricing\n*   Fuel Efficiency\n*   Safety Ratings\n*   Customer Reviews\n\n10. **Data Comparison and Scoring**\n\n\t* Create a system to compare the features of various models\n\t* Assign scores based on the importance of various attributes (e.g. Safety, Price, Fuel Efficiency), this should be part of the Recommendation Generation step. \n\n11. **Final Report Generation:**\n\n    The final report will include a summary of the search process, the data retrieved, the analysis performed, and the recommendation generated. It will also include any risks or warnings associated with the recommendation. The report should be well-structured and easy to understand. It should also contain links to the original data sources for verification purposes.",

Addressing the previous timeout issue and incorporating error handling to ensure reliable data retrieval. A data validation step has also been included to ensure accuracy.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The initial attempt to gather information on recent Mahindra car launches resulted in a timeout error, indicating a need for a more targeted search approach. Building on the previous analysis, the search strategy has been refined into smaller, more specific queries to reduce the risk of timeout errors and improve the accuracy and reliability of the data retrieved. The implementation involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Searches for Recent Launches:**\n\n    *   Query 1: 'Mahindra car launches 2023'\n    *   Query 2: 'Mahindra car launches 2024'\n\n    These queries will identify specific models that have been launched in the past two years. The search results will be parsed to extract model names and any available specifications or features.\n\n2.  **Model-Specific Searches:**\n\n    Once specific models are identified, subsequent searches will be performed to gather detailed technical specifications and pricing information for each model.\n\n    *   Query 3: 'Mahindra [Model Name] specifications'\n    *   Query 4: 'Mahindra [Model Name] price in India'\n\n    For example, if the initial searches identify the 'Mahindra XUV700' and 'Mahindra Scorpio N' as relevant models, the subsequent searches would be:\n\n    *   'Mahindra XUV700 specifications'\n    *   'Mahindra XUV700 price in India'\n    *   'Mahindra Scorpio N specifications'\n    *   'Mahindra Scorpio N price in India'\n\n3.  **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**\n\n    Given the previous timeout error, it is essential to implement robust error handling. The code will include mechanisms to detect and handle timeout errors gracefully. If a timeout occurs, the agent will retry the query after a short delay (e.g., 5 seconds). This can be achieved using try-except blocks in the code. The number of retries will be limited to prevent infinite loops.\n\n4.  **Logging Search Query Results:**\n\n    To aid in debugging and diagnosing any issues, the results of each search query will be logged. This includes the query terms, the search results (URLs and snippets), and any errors encountered. The logs will be stored in a file with timestamps for easy analysis. The logs should be detailed enough to understand the full context of the search. This will help pinpoint issues and aid in refining the search queries or error handling mechanisms.\n\n5.  **Data Extraction and Consolidation:**\n\n    The search results will be parsed to extract relevant information, such as model names, specifications, features, pricing, and launch dates. This data will be consolidated into a structured format (e.g., a dictionary or a pandas DataFrame) for further analysis and recommendation. The extraction logic must be robust enough to handle variations in website layouts and formats. Regular expressions and HTML parsing libraries can be used to extract the relevant data elements.\n\n6.  **Data Verification:**\n\n    To ensure accuracy, the extracted data will be verified against multiple sources. This involves comparing the information from different websites and looking for consistent data. Any discrepancies will be flagged for manual review. This is crucial to avoid providing the user with incorrect or misleading information. Data verification should include cross-referencing specifications, features, and prices from multiple sources. The agent will identify any major inconsistencies and generate a report detailing them.\n\n7.  **Handling Empty Results:**\n\n    The agent must handle cases where the search queries return empty results. This could happen if a particular model is not launched in a specific year or if the information is not available online. The agent should log these instances and attempt alternative search queries or data sources. The agent should also flag these cases to be reviewed manually to determine if any information is available through alternative channels.\n\n8.  **Recommendation Generation:**\n\n    Based on the consolidated and verified data, the agent will generate a recommendation for the user. This will involve considering factors such as features, price, value proposition, target audience, and user preferences. The recommendation will be presented in a clear and concise format, highlighting the key benefits of the recommended model. The recommendation should include a rationale explaining why the specific model is being recommended based on the user's requirements.\n\n9.  **Features to collect for each model**\n\n*   Launch Date\n*   Trim Levels\n*   Available Features (Safety, Technology, Comfort)\n*   Technical Specifications (Engine, Transmission, Dimensions)\n*   Pricing\n*   Fuel Efficiency\n*   Safety Ratings\n*   Customer Reviews\n\n10. **Data Comparison and Scoring**\n\n\t* Create a system to compare the features of various models\n\t* Assign scores based on the importance of various attributes (e.g. Safety, Price, Fuel Efficiency), this should be part of the Recommendation Generation step. \n\n11. **Final Report Generation:**\n\n    The final report will include a summary of the search process, the data retrieved, the analysis performed, and the recommendation generated. It will also include any risks or warnings associated with the recommendation. The report should be well-structured and easy to understand. It should also contain links to the original data sources for verification purposes.",

Given the limitations encountered, it's essential to break down the initial search into smaller, more specific queries. The initial attempt used the broad search query 'Mahindra car recent launches models updates 2023 2024 technical specifications'. A more effective strategy would be to separate this into several focused queries. For example: \n\n1.  'Mahindra car launches 2023'\n2.  'Mahindra car launches 2024'\n3.  'Mahindra new car models specifications'\n4.  'Mahindra car price India'\n\nThe re-attempt will use these refined queries to gather information. This approach reduces the risk of timeout errors and facilitates the extraction of relevant data in a manageable format. For each car identified through these searches, subsequent queries can be made to gather detailed specifications, features, and customer reviews.\n\nIf initial searches yield specific model names, individual searches can target 'Mahindra [Model Name] specifications' or 'Mahindra [Model Name] price in India' for more granular information.\n\nFollowing successful data retrieval, the agent will analyze each car launch, considering factors like:\n\n*   **Features**: Key highlights, innovative technologies, safety features, comfort, and convenience.\n*   **Price**: Ex-showroom price in India, on-road price variations across different cities.\n*   **Overall Value Proposition**: Considering the combination of features, price, brand reputation, and customer feedback.\n*   **Target Audience**: Based on the car type, target customers, usability.\n\nThe final recommendation will be justified based on a comprehensive comparison of these factors, considering that the user is intending to buy a car. The recommendation will outline which model offers the best combination of features, value, and suitability based on the available data.\n\nThe absence of initial data prevents a full report at this time.

Addressing the previous timeout issue and incorporating error handling to ensure reliable data retrieval. A data validation step has also been included to ensure accuracy.",
                "detailed": "Let me think through this: The initial attempt to gather information on recent Mahindra car launches resulted in a timeout error, indicating a need for a more targeted search approach. Building on the previous analysis, the search strategy has been refined into smaller, more specific queries to reduce the risk of timeout errors and improve the accuracy and reliability of the data retrieved. The implementation involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Searches for Recent Launches:**\n\n    *   Query 1: 'Mahindra car launches 2023'\n    *   Query 2: 'Mahindra car launches 2024'\n\n    These queries will identify specific models that have been launched in the past two years. The search results will be parsed to extract model names and any available specifications or features.\n\n2.  **Model-Specific Searches:**\n\n    Once specific models are identified, subsequent searches will be performed to gather detailed technical specifications and pricing information for each model.\n\n    *   Query 3: 'Mahindra [Model Name] specifications'\n    *   Query 4: 'Mahindra [Model Name] price in India'\n\n    For example, if the initial searches identify the 'Mahindra XUV700' and 'Mahindra Scorpio N' as relevant models, the subsequent searches would be:\n\n    *   'Mahindra XUV700 specifications'\n    *   'Mahindra XUV700 price in India'\n    *   'Mahindra Scorpio N specifications'\n    *   'Mahindra Scorpio N price in India'\n\n3.  **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**\n\n    Given the previous timeout error, it is essential to implement robust error handling. The code will include mechanisms to detect and handle timeout errors gracefully. If a timeout occurs, the agent will retry the query after a short delay (e.g., 5 seconds). This can be achieved using try-except blocks in the code. The number of retries will be limited to prevent infinite loops.\n\n4.  **Logging Search Query Results:**\n\n    To aid in debugging and diagnosing any issues, the results of each search query will be logged. This includes the query terms, the search results (URLs and snippets), and any errors encountered. The logs will be stored in a file with timestamps for easy analysis. The logs should be detailed enough to understand the full context of the search. This will help pinpoint issues and aid in refining the search queries or error handling mechanisms.\n\n5.  **Data Extraction and Consolidation:**\n\n    The search results will be parsed to extract relevant information, such as model names, specifications, features, pricing, and launch dates. This data will be consolidated into a structured format (e.g., a dictionary or a pandas DataFrame) for further analysis and recommendation. The extraction logic must be robust enough to handle variations in website layouts and formats. Regular expressions and HTML parsing libraries can be used to extract the relevant data elements.\n\n6.  **Data Verification:**\n\n    To ensure accuracy, the extracted data will be verified against multiple sources. This involves comparing the information from different websites and looking for consistent data. Any discrepancies will be flagged for manual review. This is crucial to avoid providing the user with incorrect or misleading information. Data verification should include cross-referencing specifications, features, and prices from multiple sources. The agent will identify any major inconsistencies and generate a report detailing them.\n\n7.  **Handling Empty Results:**\n\n    The agent must handle cases where the search queries return empty results. This could happen if a particular model is not launched in a specific year or if the information is not available online. The agent should log these instances and attempt alternative search queries or data sources. The agent should also flag these cases to be reviewed manually to determine if any information is available through alternative channels.\n\n8.  **Recommendation Generation:**\n\n    Based on the consolidated and verified data, the agent will generate a recommendation for the user. This will involve considering factors such as features, price, value proposition, target audience, and user preferences. The recommendation will be presented in a clear and concise format, highlighting the key benefits of the recommended model. The recommendation should include a rationale explaining why the specific model is being recommended based on the user's requirements.\n\n9.  **Features to collect for each model**\n\n*   Launch Date\n*   Trim Levels\n*   Available Features (Safety, Technology, Comfort)\n*   Technical Specifications (Engine, Transmission, Dimensions)\n*   Pricing\n*   Fuel Efficiency\n*   Safety Ratings\n*   Customer Reviews\n\n10. **Data Comparison and Scoring**\n\n\t* Create a system to compare the features of various models\n\t* Assign scores based on the importance of various attributes (e.g. Safety, Price, Fuel Efficiency), this should be part of the Recommendation Generation step. \n\n11. **Final Report Generation:**\n\n    The final report will include a summary of the search process, the data retrieved, the analysis performed, and the recommendation generated. It will also include any risks or warnings associated with the recommendation. The report should be well-structured and easy to understand. It should also contain links to the original data sources for verification purposes.",
