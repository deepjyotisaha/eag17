In order to further strengthen its position in the UV segment, Mahindra plans to launch a range of new SUVs in the next 2-3 years.

Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

            "summary": "Based on recent launches, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is recommended as the latest vehicle, aligning with the compact SUV trend and offering a blend of features, style, and value.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the analysis of the retrieved information regarding Mahindra's recent car launches and models, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is recommended as the latest vehicle that aligns with the user's interest in a new car. This recommendation is based on several factors, including its recent launch, its classification as a compact SUV (a segment experiencing significant growth and popularity), and its promising features that cater to a wide range of potential buyers.\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in 2024, represents Mahindra's latest offering in the competitive compact SUV market. This segment has witnessed substantial growth in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for vehicles that offer the practicality of an SUV with the maneuverability and fuel efficiency of a smaller car. The XUV 3XO is positioned to capitalize on this trend by providing a compelling combination of style, features, and performance.\n\nKey Selling Points and Suitability:\n\n*   **Modern Design and Styling:** The XUV 3XO features a contemporary design language that is both eye-catching and aerodynamic. Its exterior design incorporates sleek lines, a bold front grille, and stylish lighting elements, giving it a distinctive and premium appearance. This makes it an attractive option for buyers who prioritize aesthetics and want a vehicle that stands out from the crowd.\n\n*   **Feature-Rich Interior:** The interior of the XUV 3XO is designed to provide a comfortable and convenient driving experience. It boasts a spacious cabin with ample legroom and headroom for both front and rear passengers. The dashboard is well-laid-out and features a user-friendly infotainment system with a touchscreen display, offering seamless connectivity and access to various vehicle functions. Features like automatic climate control, a sunroof, and premium upholstery add to the overall sense of luxury and refinement.\n\n*   **Advanced Technology:** The XUV 3XO is equipped with a range of advanced technology features that enhance safety, convenience, and entertainment. These include features like a rearview camera, parking sensors, electronic stability control (ESC), and multiple airbags. The infotainment system supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing users to seamlessly integrate their smartphones with the vehicle.\n\n*   **Efficient Powertrain Options:** The XUV 3XO is available with a choice of efficient and powerful powertrain options, catering to different driving preferences and needs. These engines are designed to deliver a balance of performance and fuel economy, making the XUV 3XO suitable for both city driving and long-distance journeys. The availability of both manual and automatic transmissions further enhances its versatility.\n\n*   **Competitive Pricing:** Mahindra has strategically priced the XUV 3XO to make it a compelling value proposition in the compact SUV segment. Its price point undercuts many of its rivals, making it an accessible option for a wider range of buyers.\n\nRationale for Recommendation:\n\nThe recommendation of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is based on its ability to meet the needs and preferences of a typical new car buyer in the current market. Its combination of style, features, performance, and value makes it an attractive option for those seeking a versatile and practical vehicle.\n\n*   **Alignment with User Needs:** The XUV 3XO addresses the user's interest in a new car by offering a fresh and up-to-date model with the latest features and technology. Its suitability for the user's needs is further enhanced by its compact SUV classification, which aligns with the trend towards smaller, more fuel-efficient SUVs.\n\n*   **Consideration of Recent Trends:** The recommendation takes into account the recent trends in the SUV and compact SUV segments. The growing popularity of compact SUVs is driven by their practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability, making them ideal for urban environments. The XUV 3XO caters to this trend by offering a well-rounded package that meets the needs of modern drivers.\n\n*   **Competitive Advantage:** The XUV 3XO stands out from its competitors due to its unique combination of features, styling, and value. Its modern design, feature-rich interior, and efficient powertrain options make it a compelling alternative to other compact SUVs on the market. Its competitive pricing further enhances its appeal.\n\nAlternatives Considered:\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO is the primary recommendation, other Mahindra vehicles were considered, including:\n\n*   **Mahindra 5-door Thar:** This vehicle is suitable for buyers who prioritize off-roading capabilities and a rugged design. However, it may not be the best choice for those seeking a comfortable and refined driving experience.\n\n*   **Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus:** This vehicle is a practical option for those who need a seven-seater SUV with ample cargo space. However, its design and features may not be as modern or appealing as the XUV 3XO.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is the recommended vehicle due to its alignment with the user's needs, its consideration of recent trends in the SUV market, and its competitive advantage over other vehicles in its class. Its combination of style, features, performance, and value makes it an excellent choice for a new car buyer seeking a versatile and practical vehicle.",

The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

Safety will also be considered in the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door as it is likely to come with dual airbags up front, ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors, parking sensors at the rear, and ABS with EBD. We can expect the price of the new Mahindra Thar 5-door to be around Rs 15 lakh to16 lakh (ex-showroom). Mahindra XUV400 EV Mahindra & Mahindra is planning to launch a plethora of EVs in the Indian auto market. XUV400 EV is one of them which is essentially an electric version of the eXUV300. The model is based on the tweaked platform of the XUV300 . Even the interior layout will almost be the same as the SUV300 including the 7-inch infotainment screen and instrument cluster. The only change we can expect to see is that the new Mahindra XUV400 EV will replace its gear shifter with a gear selector which looks quite futuristic. Mahindra XUV400 EV will have a 40kWh battery pack which can produce 146 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. The model will get three driving modes; Fun, Fast, and Fearless. As claimed by the brand, the XUV400 EV can sprint from 0 to 100 kmph in just 8.3 seconds. In terms of range, the XUV400 has an ARAI-certified driving range of 456 kms on one single charge. Using a 50 KW DC fast charger, the model can be charged up to 80 percent in 50 minutes. The expected price of this model will be in the range of Rs 17 lakh to 22 lakh (ex-showroom). Its bookings will begin in January 2023. Mahindra eKUV100 After a series of delays, the upcoming Mahindra eKUV100 will be the most affordable EV in the brands product portfolio. As reported, the model is expected to be launched in January 2023. Mahindra eKUV100 will be offered with a 16kWh battery pack which is likely to produce 53 bhp and 120 Nm of torque. As claimed by the company, the model will offer an electric range of 150 kms. The steering and suspension have also been modified to compensate for the battery pack. Inside the cabin, the upcoming eKUV100 is expected to borrow some interior ideas from XUV300 and the upcoming XUV400. The expected price of the Mahindra eKUV100 will range between Rs 8 to 9 lakh (ex-showroom).

However, it is facing tough competition from the likes of Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors in the UV space. Determined to regain lost ground in the segment, Mahindra had introduced multiple new SUVs including the new Thar, XUV700 and the Scorpio-N. In order to further strengthen its position in the UV segment, Mahindra plans to launch a range of new SUVs in the next 2-3 years. Heres a look at all upcoming Mahindra cars in India in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Upcoming Mahindra Cars in 2023, 2024, 2025 1.

In terms of proportions, the SUV is 4400mm long, 1795mm wide and 1812mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2680mm.

The SUV will be powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine with a 6-speed manual gearbox.

The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

As is well known, the upcoming Thar 5-door could be revealed / launched around the Delhi Auto Expo 2023 . Keeping this in mind, let us see what we can expect from the upcoming Mahindra cars in 2023 in terms of powertrain, features, and pricing. Mahindra Thar 5-door Mahindra Thar has been one of the biggest hits in the Indian car market. In order to make it more occupant friendly, the company will be launching the 5-door version sometime in 2023. Speaking of power, the new Thar 5-door is likely to retain the front design aspects as the current 3-door model. In addition, the new Thar is expected to carry the same 2.0-litre turbo-petrol and 2.2-litre mHawk diesel engines which will produce 147 bhp / 300 Nm of torque and 128 bhp / 300 Nm of torque respectively. In terms of features, we can expect that the new SUV would be offered with equipment like automatic climate control, air conditioning vents at the rear, and push-button (start/stop). Safety will also be considered in the upcoming Mahindra Thar 5-door as it is likely to come with dual airbags up front, ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors, parking sensors at the rear, and ABS with EBD. We can expect the price of the new Mahindra Thar 5-door to be around Rs 15 lakh to16 lakh (ex-showroom). Mahindra XUV400 EV Mahindra & Mahindra is planning to launch a plethora of EVs in the Indian auto market. XUV400 EV is one of them which is essentially an electric version of the eXUV300. The model is based on the tweaked platform of the XUV300 . Even the interior layout will almost be the same as the SUV300 including the 7-inch infotainment screen and instrument cluster. The only change we can expect to see is that the new Mahindra XUV400 EV will replace its gear shifter with a gear selector which looks quite futuristic. Mahindra XUV400 EV will have a 40kWh battery pack which can produce 146 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. The model will get three driving modes; Fun, Fast, and Fearless. As claimed by the brand, the XUV400 EV can sprint from 0 to 100 kmph in just 8.3 seconds. In terms of range, the XUV400 has an ARAI-certified driving range of 456 kms on one single charge. Using a 50 KW DC fast charger, the model can be charged up to 80 percent in 50 minutes. The expected price of this model will be in the range of Rs 17 lakh to 22 lakh (ex-showroom). Its bookings will begin in January 2023. Mahindra eKUV100 After a series of delays, the upcoming Mahindra eKUV100 will be the most affordable EV in the brands product portfolio. As reported, the model is expected to be launched in January 2023. Mahindra eKUV100 will be offered with a 16kWh battery pack which is likely to produce 53 bhp and 120 Nm of torque. As claimed by the company, the model will offer an electric range of 150 kms. The steering and suspension have also been modified to compensate for the battery pack. Inside the cabin, the upcoming eKUV100 is expected to borrow some interior ideas from XUV300 and the upcoming XUV400. The expected price of the Mahindra eKUV100 will range between Rs 8 to 9 lakh (ex-showroom).

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the analysis of the retrieved information regarding Mahindra's recent car launches and models, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is recommended as the latest vehicle that aligns with the user's interest in a new car. This recommendation is based on several factors, including its recent launch, its classification as a compact SUV (a segment experiencing significant growth and popularity), and its promising features that cater to a wide range of potential buyers.\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in 2024, represents Mahindra's latest offering in the competitive compact SUV market. This segment has witnessed substantial growth in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for vehicles that offer the practicality of an SUV with the maneuverability and fuel efficiency of a smaller car. The XUV 3XO is positioned to capitalize on this trend by providing a compelling combination of style, features, and performance.\n\nKey Selling Points and Suitability:\n\n*   **Modern Design and Styling:** The XUV 3XO features a contemporary design language that is both eye-catching and aerodynamic. Its exterior design incorporates sleek lines, a bold front grille, and stylish lighting elements, giving it a distinctive and premium appearance. This makes it an attractive option for buyers who prioritize aesthetics and want a vehicle that stands out from the crowd.\n\n*   **Feature-Rich Interior:** The interior of the XUV 3XO is designed to provide a comfortable and convenient driving experience. It boasts a spacious cabin with ample legroom and headroom for both front and rear passengers. The dashboard is well-laid-out and features a user-friendly infotainment system with a touchscreen display, offering seamless connectivity and access to various vehicle functions. Features like automatic climate control, a sunroof, and premium upholstery add to the overall sense of luxury and refinement.\n\n*   **Advanced Technology:** The XUV 3XO is equipped with a range of advanced technology features that enhance safety, convenience, and entertainment. These include features like a rearview camera, parking sensors, electronic stability control (ESC), and multiple airbags. The infotainment system supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing users to seamlessly integrate their smartphones with the vehicle.\n\n*   **Efficient Powertrain Options:** The XUV 3XO is available with a choice of efficient and powerful powertrain options, catering to different driving preferences and needs. These engines are designed to deliver a balance of performance and fuel economy, making the XUV 3XO suitable for both city driving and long-distance journeys. The availability of both manual and automatic transmissions further enhances its versatility.\n\n*   **Competitive Pricing:** Mahindra has strategically priced the XUV 3XO to make it a compelling value proposition in the compact SUV segment. Its price point undercuts many of its rivals, making it an accessible option for a wider range of buyers.\n\nRationale for Recommendation:\n\nThe recommendation of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is based on its ability to meet the needs and preferences of a typical new car buyer in the current market. Its combination of style, features, performance, and value makes it an attractive option for those seeking a versatile and practical vehicle.\n\n*   **Alignment with User Needs:** The XUV 3XO addresses the user's interest in a new car by offering a fresh and up-to-date model with the latest features and technology. Its suitability for the user's needs is further enhanced by its compact SUV classification, which aligns with the trend towards smaller, more fuel-efficient SUVs.\n\n*   **Consideration of Recent Trends:** The recommendation takes into account the recent trends in the SUV and compact SUV segments. The growing popularity of compact SUVs is driven by their practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability, making them ideal for urban environments. The XUV 3XO caters to this trend by offering a well-rounded package that meets the needs of modern drivers.\n\n*   **Competitive Advantage:** The XUV 3XO stands out from its competitors due to its unique combination of features, styling, and value. Its modern design, feature-rich interior, and efficient powertrain options make it a compelling alternative to other compact SUVs on the market. Its competitive pricing further enhances its appeal.\n\nAlternatives Considered:\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO is the primary recommendation, other Mahindra vehicles were considered, including:\n\n*   **Mahindra 5-door Thar:** This vehicle is suitable for buyers who prioritize off-roading capabilities and a rugged design. However, it may not be the best choice for those seeking a comfortable and refined driving experience.\n\n*   **Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus:** This vehicle is a practical option for those who need a seven-seater SUV with ample cargo space. However, its design and features may not be as modern or appealing as the XUV 3XO.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is the recommended vehicle due to its alignment with the user's needs, its consideration of recent trends in the SUV market, and its competitive advantage over other vehicles in its class. Its combination of style, features, performance, and value makes it an excellent choice for a new car buyer seeking a versatile and practical vehicle.",
