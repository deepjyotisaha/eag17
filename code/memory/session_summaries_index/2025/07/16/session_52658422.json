In terms of proportions, the SUV is 4400mm long, 1795mm wide and 1812mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2680mm. The new model looks largely identical to the Bolero Neo; however, it received some changes to keep things fresh. Instead of a blacked-out C-pillar, it has body-coloured pillars. It gets new rear bumper and smaller reflector panels, a tailgate-mounted spare tyre with badging and extended rear door. The SUV will be powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine with a 6-speed manual gearbox. This powertrain produces 130PS and 300Nm of torque. 2. 5-door Mahindra Thar The next model in our list of upcoming Mahindra cars is the 5-door or long wheelbase version of the Mahindra Thar. It is expected to be launched by the end of 2023 or early 2024. The 5-door Mahindra Thar will have 300mm longer wheelbase than its 3-door model. It is expected to be based on the new Scorpio-Ns ladder-frame chassis with increased width between the wheelbase for bettery wheelbase-to-track ratio.

Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/thar/THRN.html', 'content': \"Mahindra Thar SUV - Price, Specs, Images & Colors | 3-Door Skip to main content Skip to footer content SUVs THAR ROXX 12.99L - 23.39L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore XUV 3XO 7.99L - 15.79L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore SCORPIO-N 13.99L - 25.62L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore XUV700 14.49L - 25.14L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore THAR 11.50L - 17.62L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore SCORPIO CLASSIC 13.77L - 17.72L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore BOLERO NEO 9.97L - 12.18L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore BOLERO NEO PLUS 11.41L - 14.06L Explore Explore BOLERO 9.81L - 10.93L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore XUV400 17.49L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore MARAZZO 14.59L - 17.00L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore Explore All SUVs Explore All SUVs News Contact Us Menu Build your car Test Drive Buy Buy Book Now Exchange Finance Subscribe a Vehicle Owner's Zone Owner's Zone Owner's Action Owner's Action My Dashboard Service Cost Calculator Locate Service Center Renewals Renewals Roadside Assistance Owner's Manual Care & Maintenance Important Notifications Important Notifications Service Action Adventure Adventure Club Events Expeditions Off-Road Academy Gallery Locate a Dealer Global Markets Language News Contact us Switch theme Dark Light Home THAR Show more Show less Show more Show less Show more Show less Register for the latest news and exclusive updates.

Therefore, this report will identify potential candidates and outline the steps required to reach a definitive recommendation.\n\n**Candidate Vehicles**\nBased on the provided information, the following vehicles are considered as potential candidates:\n*   **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift:** Expected launch in February 2024.\n*   **Mahindra Thar 5-Door:** Expected launch in March 2024 or later.\n*   **Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus:** Expected launch later in 2024.\n*   **Mahindra XUV400 Facelift:** Expected launch in the second half of 2024.\n*   **Mahindra XUV.e8:** Expected launch at the end of 2024.\n\n**Analysis of Launch Dates**\nAmong the candidates, the Mahindra XUV300 Facelift has the earliest anticipated launch date (February 2024). However, it is crucial to confirm the actual launch date and availability in the market. The Thar 5-Door is another strong contender, but the launch timeframe is less precise.\n\n**Need for Market Reviews and User Ratings**\nA definitive recommendation cannot be made without considering market reviews and user ratings. These provide valuable insights into the vehicle's performance, reliability, and overall customer satisfaction. These parameters are missing in the initial search results.\n\n**Detailed Comparison of Expected Features**\nAs a substitute for real-world reviews, a comparison of expected features can provide some guidance. However, it is important to note that these are based on pre-launch information and may not accurately reflect the final product.\n\n*   **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift:**\n    *   Exterior design changes\n    *   Redesigned cabin\n    *   Potential ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)\n    *   Petrol and diesel engine options\n*   **Mahindra Thar 5-Door:**\n    *   Larger footprint than the 3-door model\n    *   Bigger infotainment system\n    *   Sunroof\n    *   Petrol and diesel engine options\n    *   4-wheel-drive (4WD) and rear-wheel-drive (RWD) configurations\n*   **Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus:**\n    * 7 and 9-seater configurations\n    * 2.2L mHawk diesel engine\n    * 6-speed manual gearbox\n*   **Mahindra XUV400 Facelift:**\n    * Design updates similar to XUV300 Facelift\n    * Improved range\n    * Retaining existing 34.5 kWh and 39.4 kWh battery pack options\n*   **Mahindra XUV.e8:**\n    * All-electric version of XUV700\n    * Two battery pack options (60 kWh to 80 kWh)\n    * Dual-motor all-wheel drivetrain availability\n    * Expected range of around 450 km\n\n**Next Steps**\nTo provide a definitive recommendation, the following steps are necessary:\n\n1.  **Confirm Launch Dates:** Verify the actual launch dates for each vehicle.\n2.  **Gather Market Reviews:** Search for reviews from reputable automotive publications and websites.\n3.  **Collect User Ratings:** Monitor online forums and customer feedback platforms for user ratings and reviews.\n4.  **Analyze Data:** Conduct a comparative analysis of reviews and ratings, considering factors such as performance, reliability, features, and value for money.\n5.  **Refine Recommendation:** Based on the analysis, identify the vehicle with the most positive reviews and high user ratings.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on currently available information, the Mahindra XUV300 Facelift appears to be the most recent launch. However, a definitive recommendation requires further data gathering and analysis of market reviews and user ratings. Once this information is available, a more informed and reliable recommendation can be provided.\n",

However, it is facing tough competition from the likes of Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors in the UV space. Determined to regain lost ground in the segment, Mahindra had introduced multiple new SUVs including the new Thar, XUV700 and the Scorpio-N. In order to further strengthen its position in the UV segment, Mahindra plans to launch a range of new SUVs in the next 2-3 years. Heres a look at all upcoming Mahindra cars in India in 2023, 2024 and 2025. ads Upcoming Mahindra Cars in 2023, 2024, 2025 1.

In terms of proportions, the SUV is 4400mm long, 1795mm wide and 1812mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2680mm. The new model looks largely identical to the Bolero Neo; however, it received some changes to keep things fresh. Instead of a blacked-out C-pillar, it has body-coloured pillars. It gets new rear bumper and smaller reflector panels, a tailgate-mounted spare tyre with badging and extended rear door. The SUV will be powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine with a 6-speed manual gearbox. This powertrain produces 130PS and 300Nm of torque. 2. 5-door Mahindra Thar The next model in our list of upcoming Mahindra cars is the 5-door or long wheelbase version of the Mahindra Thar. It is expected to be launched by the end of 2023 or early 2024. The 5-door Mahindra Thar will have 300mm longer wheelbase than its 3-door model. It is expected to be based on the new Scorpio-Ns ladder-frame chassis with increased width between the wheelbase for bettery wheelbase-to-track ratio. The SUV will have an extra door for the middle row passengers. The cabin layout will be similar to the existing model and will have a three seat bench layout in the middle row and provide bigger boot space. The SUV is expected to share its powertrains with the Scorpio N. It will be offered with a 200bhp, 2.0L turbo petrol and a 172bhp, 2.2L turbo diesel engine. It can be had with either a manual or an automatic gearbox. 3. New-gen Mahindra Bolero Mahindra will launch the next gen Bolero in our market in 2024.

Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/thar/THRN.html', 'content': \"Mahindra Thar SUV - Price, Specs, Images & Colors | 3-Door Skip to main content Skip to footer content SUVs THAR ROXX 12.99L - 23.39L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore XUV 3XO 7.99L - 15.79L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore SCORPIO-N 13.99L - 25.62L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore XUV700 14.49L - 25.14L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore THAR 11.50L - 17.62L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore SCORPIO CLASSIC 13.77L - 17.72L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore BOLERO NEO 9.97L - 12.18L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore BOLERO NEO PLUS 11.41L - 14.06L Explore Explore BOLERO 9.81L - 10.93L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore XUV400 17.49L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore MARAZZO 14.59L - 17.00L Book Now Book Now Explore Explore Explore All SUVs Explore All SUVs News Contact Us Menu Build your car Test Drive Buy Buy Book Now Exchange Finance Subscribe a Vehicle Owner's Zone Owner's Zone Owner's Action Owner's Action My Dashboard Service Cost Calculator Locate Service Center Renewals Renewals Roadside Assistance Owner's Manual Care & Maintenance Important Notifications Important Notifications Service Action Adventure Adventure Club Events Expeditions Off-Road Academy Gallery Locate a Dealer Global Markets Language News Contact us Switch theme Dark Light Home THAR Show more Show less Show more Show less Show more Show less Register for the latest news and exclusive updates.

The primary goal is to identify the most recent vehicle, considering market reviews and user ratings. However, the current data primarily focuses on expected launches and specifications. Therefore, this report will identify potential candidates and outline the steps required to reach a definitive recommendation.\n\n**Candidate Vehicles**\nBased on the provided information, the following vehicles are considered as potential candidates:\n*   **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift:** Expected launch in February 2024.\n*   **Mahindra Thar 5-Door:** Expected launch in March 2024 or later.\n*   **Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus:** Expected launch later in 2024.\n*   **Mahindra XUV400 Facelift:** Expected launch in the second half of 2024.\n*   **Mahindra XUV.e8:** Expected launch at the end of 2024.\n\n**Analysis of Launch Dates**\nAmong the candidates, the Mahindra XUV300 Facelift has the earliest anticipated launch date (February 2024). However, it is crucial to confirm the actual launch date and availability in the market. The Thar 5-Door is another strong contender, but the launch timeframe is less precise.\n\n**Need for Market Reviews and User Ratings**\nA definitive recommendation cannot be made without considering market reviews and user ratings.

The rear sees major styling updates too, that include a completely redesigned tailgate with a full-width LED light bar. The tail-lamps appear sleeker and C-shaped, and the registration plate is now housed on the bumper instead of on the tailgate.
