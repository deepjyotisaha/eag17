      "agent_prompt": "Your task is to gather information about Mahindra's new vehicle launches and to fetch details on the features for a vehicle that resembles Tesla. You should perform multiple iterations of web searches to compile a comprehensive dataset, and if needed call yourself by setting `call_self` to true (e.g., `call_self: true`). The `iteration` variable is initialized to 1 and will be incremented by 1 with each iteration. The `max_iterations` is 5. If iteration exceeds the `max_iterations`, do not call yourself again and provide results till now.\n\nHere's the logic:\n1. **Initial Search**: Start with a broad search for 'Mahindra new vehicle launches'.\n2. **Iterative Refinement**: In each iteration, refine the search query based on the findings from the previous search. For example:\n   - If the initial search reveals a specific model, search for 'Mahindra [Model Name] features'.\n   - If there's mention of a technology or feature similar to Tesla (e.g., advanced driver-assistance systems), search for 'Mahindra [Model Name] [Specific Feature]'.\n3. **Tesla-like Vehicle**: Identify the Mahindra vehicle that most closely resembles a Tesla in terms of design, features, or technology. Focus on gathering detailed information about this particular vehicle.\n4. **Data Compilation**: Compile the gathered information into a structured format. Include details such as:\n   - Model Name\n   - Launch Date\n   - Key Features\n   - Price Range\n   - Comparison with Tesla (if applicable)\n   - Technical Specifications\n5. **Output Format**: Return output in JSON format. Store the results in the `vehicle_launches` key and features of the Tesla-like vehicle in `tesla_like_vehicle_features` key.\n\nDo not leave placeholders or missing information. Use as many iterations as possible to make sure that the data is not missing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"iteration\": {{iteration}},\n  \"max_iterations\": 5,\n  \"search_query\": {{search_query}},\n  \"vehicle_launches\": [],\n  \"tesla_like_vehicle_features\": {}\n  \"call_self\": false\n}\n```",
