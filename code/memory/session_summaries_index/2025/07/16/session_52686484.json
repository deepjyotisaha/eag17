Here are the top five Mahindra SUV and electric vehicle launches expected in India. Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

In terms of proportions, the SUV is 4400mm long, 1795mm wide and 1812mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2680mm.

The SUV will be powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine with a 6-speed manual gearbox.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://motoroctane.com/news/230167-upcoming-mahindra-cars-for-2023-24', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://teamcardelight.com/mahindras-4-new-launches-in-2024-all-the-details/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.rushlane.com/new-mahindra-suv-launches-planned-for-2024-12483885.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

            "summary": "The Mahindra Thar 5-door is recommended for its blend of practicality, off-road capability, and broad appeal. It combines the ruggedness of the Thar with the convenience of a 5-door configuration, making it suitable for both adventurous individuals and families.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: After reviewing the Mahindra car launches data, the Mahindra Thar 5-door emerges as the most suitable vehicle based on the criteria of newness, features, and overall appeal to a broad range of consumers. While other models like the XUV300 Facelift, XUV400 Facelift, XUV.e8, and Bolero Neo Plus offer unique selling points, the Thar 5-door strikes a compelling balance between practicality, capability, and market excitement.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1.  **Newness:** The Thar 5-door is an entirely new variant of an already popular model. This novelty factor generates significant buzz and attracts a wide audience eager to experience the updated design and functionality.\n2.  **Features:** The 5-door configuration addresses a key limitation of the original Thar – its lack of practicality for families and passengers. The addition of rear doors and increased space enhances accessibility and comfort, making it a more versatile vehicle for everyday use. The search results indicate that the Thar 5-door will likely retain the off-road capabilities of the 3-door model, with available 4WD and RWD configurations, petrol and diesel engine options, and a potentially larger infotainment system with sunroof. This blend of ruggedness and convenience broadens its appeal beyond hardcore off-road enthusiasts.\n3.  **Overall Appeal:** The Thar 5-door taps into a growing trend of adventure-lifestyle vehicles. It offers a unique combination of off-road capability, rugged styling, and everyday practicality, appealing to individuals and families who seek a vehicle that can handle both urban commutes and weekend excursions. The Thar's strong brand recognition and aspirational image further contribute to its broad appeal.\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n\nTo understand why the Thar 5-door stands out, let's compare it to the other mentioned models:\n\n*   **XUV300 Facelift & XUV400 Facelift:** These are refreshed versions of existing models, primarily targeting urban consumers. While they offer updated styling and features, they lack the novelty and aspirational appeal of the Thar 5-door.\n*   **XUV.e8 (Electric XUV700):** This electric SUV caters to a niche market of eco-conscious buyers. While it boasts impressive technology and range, its higher price point and limited charging infrastructure may restrict its appeal to a smaller segment.\n*   **Bolero Neo Plus:** This extended version of the Bolero Neo offers increased seating capacity, targeting budget-conscious buyers in rural and semi-urban markets. However, its utilitarian focus and limited features may not resonate with a broader audience.\n\n**Detailed Features (Expected):**\n\nBased on the search results, the Thar 5-door is expected to feature:\n\n*   Larger footprint compared to the 3-door model\n*   Bigger infotainment system\n*   Sunroof\n*   Petrol and diesel engine options\n*   4-wheel-drive (4WD) and rear-wheel-drive (RWD) configurations\n*   Expected price around Rs 15 lakh (as indicated by Zigwheels.com)\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe Thar 5-door is expected to appeal to a diverse range of consumers, including:\n\n*   Young professionals and millennials seeking an adventurous and stylish vehicle\n*   Families who need a practical and capable SUV for everyday use\n*   Off-road enthusiasts who desire a more comfortable and spacious option\n*   Individuals who value a vehicle with a strong brand image and resale value\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Mahindra Thar 5-door is a compelling choice for consumers seeking a vehicle that seamlessly blends practicality, capability, and aspirational appeal. Its newness, enhanced features, and broad target audience position it as the most suitable vehicle based on the given criteria.",

This highly anticipated lifestyle off-road SUV has been undergoing extensive testing, allowing us to gather key insights into its design and features. The 5-door Thar will have unique design elements to set it apart from its 3-door counterpart, and it will be more practical, with an extended length of 300mm, providing more cabin space and a larger boot. The additional length will also enable more storage spaces and cubbies, along with expected improvements in material quality. Talking about its features, the 5-door Mahindra Thar will offer more than its 3-door version. It will have a redesigned dashboard with a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system , likely supporting the latest Adrenox software and over-the-air (OTA) updates. Higher variants will exclusively feature a 10.25-inch digital driver display , while lower variants might come with a larger central multi-information display (MID), similar to the Scorpio N. A dashcam with front and rear monitoring functions will also be reserved for higher trims. The 5-door Thar will offer individual armrests for the driver and front passenger. With aim to enhance rear-seat comfort, Mahindra could equip the SUV with dedicated rear air conditioning vents and a rear center armrest for the bench seat. A single-pane, powered sunroof and leatherette seat upholstery might also be exclusive to the higher trim levels.

A test mule was recently spotted with a camera behind the interior rearview mirror (IRVM), suggesting the presence of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The SUV is also expected to offer six airbags and an advanced safety kit. As for engines, the 5-door Mahindra Thar will be offered with the same 2.0L turbo petrol and 2.2L diesel motors that power the 3-door version. Both manual and automatic transmissions will be available.

Here are the top five Mahindra SUV and electric vehicle launches expected in India. Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

In order to further strengthen its position in the UV segment, Mahindra plans to launch a range of new SUVs in the next 2-3 years. Heres a look at all upcoming Mahindra cars in India in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Upcoming Mahindra Cars in 2023, 2024, 2025 1.

In terms of proportions, the SUV is 4400mm long, 1795mm wide and 1812mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2680mm. The new model looks largely identical to the Bolero Neo; however, it received some changes to keep things fresh. Instead of a blacked-out C-pillar, it has body-coloured pillars. It gets new rear bumper and smaller reflector panels, a tailgate-mounted spare tyre with badging and extended rear door. The SUV will be powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine with a 6-speed manual gearbox.

It is expected to be launched by the end of 2023 or early 2024. The 5-door Mahindra Thar will have 300mm longer wheelbase than its 3-door model. It is expected to be based on the new Scorpio-Ns ladder-frame chassis with increased width between the wheelbase for bettery wheelbase-to-track ratio. The SUV will have an extra door for the middle row passengers. The cabin layout will be similar to the existing model and will have a three seat bench layout in the middle row and provide bigger boot space. The SUV is expected to share its powertrains with the Scorpio N. It will be offered with a 200bhp, 2.0L turbo petrol and a 172bhp, 2.2L turbo diesel engine.

It could also get some modern day features like a touchscreen infotainment system, a multi-functional steering wheel, height adjustable drivers seat and automatic AC. The SUV is likely to feature a 2.2L mHawk diesel and a 2.0L turbo petrol engine along with manual and automatic gearbox options. 4. New Mahindra XUV500 Mahindra had replaced the XUV500 SUV with an all-new XUV700 that is offered in 5-and 7-seat options. The homegrown UV maker has confirmed that the XUV500 nameplate will return and will come with significant changes. It will be significantly smaller than the previous model.

Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://motoroctane.com/news/230167-upcoming-mahindra-cars-for-2023-24', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://teamcardelight.com/mahindras-4-new-launches-in-2024-all-the-details/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.rushlane.com/new-mahindra-suv-launches-planned-for-2024-12483885.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: After reviewing the Mahindra car launches data, the Mahindra Thar 5-door emerges as the most suitable vehicle based on the criteria of newness, features, and overall appeal to a broad range of consumers. While other models like the XUV300 Facelift, XUV400 Facelift, XUV.e8, and Bolero Neo Plus offer unique selling points, the Thar 5-door strikes a compelling balance between practicality, capability, and market excitement.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1.  **Newness:** The Thar 5-door is an entirely new variant of an already popular model. This novelty factor generates significant buzz and attracts a wide audience eager to experience the updated design and functionality.\n2.  **Features:** The 5-door configuration addresses a key limitation of the original Thar – its lack of practicality for families and passengers. The addition of rear doors and increased space enhances accessibility and comfort, making it a more versatile vehicle for everyday use. The search results indicate that the Thar 5-door will likely retain the off-road capabilities of the 3-door model, with available 4WD and RWD configurations, petrol and diesel engine options, and a potentially larger infotainment system with sunroof. This blend of ruggedness and convenience broadens its appeal beyond hardcore off-road enthusiasts.\n3.  **Overall Appeal:** The Thar 5-door taps into a growing trend of adventure-lifestyle vehicles. It offers a unique combination of off-road capability, rugged styling, and everyday practicality, appealing to individuals and families who seek a vehicle that can handle both urban commutes and weekend excursions. The Thar's strong brand recognition and aspirational image further contribute to its broad appeal.\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n\nTo understand why the Thar 5-door stands out, let's compare it to the other mentioned models:\n\n*   **XUV300 Facelift & XUV400 Facelift:** These are refreshed versions of existing models, primarily targeting urban consumers. While they offer updated styling and features, they lack the novelty and aspirational appeal of the Thar 5-door.\n*   **XUV.e8 (Electric XUV700):** This electric SUV caters to a niche market of eco-conscious buyers. While it boasts impressive technology and range, its higher price point and limited charging infrastructure may restrict its appeal to a smaller segment.\n*   **Bolero Neo Plus:** This extended version of the Bolero Neo offers increased seating capacity, targeting budget-conscious buyers in rural and semi-urban markets. However, its utilitarian focus and limited features may not resonate with a broader audience.\n\n**Detailed Features (Expected):**\n\nBased on the search results, the Thar 5-door is expected to feature:\n\n*   Larger footprint compared to the 3-door model\n*   Bigger infotainment system\n*   Sunroof\n*   Petrol and diesel engine options\n*   4-wheel-drive (4WD) and rear-wheel-drive (RWD) configurations\n*   Expected price around Rs 15 lakh (as indicated by Zigwheels.com)\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe Thar 5-door is expected to appeal to a diverse range of consumers, including:\n\n*   Young professionals and millennials seeking an adventurous and stylish vehicle\n*   Families who need a practical and capable SUV for everyday use\n*   Off-road enthusiasts who desire a more comfortable and spacious option\n*   Individuals who value a vehicle with a strong brand image and resale value\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Mahindra Thar 5-door is a compelling choice for consumers seeking a vehicle that seamlessly blends practicality, capability, and aspirational appeal. Its newness, enhanced features, and broad target audience position it as the most suitable vehicle based on the given criteria.",

This highly anticipated lifestyle off-road SUV has been undergoing extensive testing, allowing us to gather key insights into its design and features. The 5-door Thar will have unique design elements to set it apart from its 3-door counterpart, and it will be more practical, with an extended length of 300mm, providing more cabin space and a larger boot. The additional length will also enable more storage spaces and cubbies, along with expected improvements in material quality. Talking about its features, the 5-door Mahindra Thar will offer more than its 3-door version. It will have a redesigned dashboard with a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system , likely supporting the latest Adrenox software and over-the-air (OTA) updates. Higher variants will exclusively feature a 10.25-inch digital driver display , while lower variants might come with a larger central multi-information display (MID), similar to the Scorpio N. A dashcam with front and rear monitoring functions will also be reserved for higher trims. The 5-door Thar will offer individual armrests for the driver and front passenger. With aim to enhance rear-seat comfort, Mahindra could equip the SUV with dedicated rear air conditioning vents and a rear center armrest for the bench seat. A single-pane, powered sunroof and leatherette seat upholstery might also be exclusive to the higher trim levels.

As for engines, the 5-door Mahindra Thar will be offered with the same 2.0L turbo petrol and 2.2L diesel motors that power the 3-door version. Both manual and automatic transmissions will be available.
