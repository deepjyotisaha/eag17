The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

According to Zigwheels the XUV 3XO has an Ex-showroom Price of Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh and was available July 2025. Several other models are planned for launch in 2025 but have not been launched as of July 2025.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report analyzes web search results to identify the latest Mahindra vehicle launch. The primary source of information is the data retrieved in step T001, which contains snippets and URLs of web pages related to Mahindra car launches. Multiple search result entries were examined to extract relevant details and establish a timeline of recent launches.\n\n**Analysis of Search Results**\n\nThe search results point to a mix of confirmed launches, upcoming models, and facelifted versions. The key sources analyzed include Carandbike, Zigwheels, and Carsandtrucks.in. A major challenge is differentiating between announcements of future models and actual market launches.\n\n*   **Carandbike:** This source mentions upcoming Mahindra cars in 2025-2026 and includes images of models like Mahindra BE.05, XUV.e8, XUV.e9, XUV900, and Scorpio X. However, it doesn't provide specific launch dates for currently available vehicles.\n*   **Zigwheels:** This source provides a comprehensive price list of Mahindra cars as of July 2025. It lists the Mahindra XUV 3XO as one of the models with a price range of Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh. This suggests a recent or current market availability, indicating a launch date close to or before July 2025. The site also lists upcoming models like the Mahindra BE 07 and Mahindra XEV 4e but labels them as 'Upcoming Models,' clearly differentiating them from currently available cars.\n*   **Carsandtrucks.in:** This source predicts several Mahindra launches and updates for 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV/XEV 4e (expected March 2025), XEV 7e (expected March 2025), Thar 3-door Facelift (expected April 2025), and BE 07 (expected August 15, 2025). These are projections, not confirmed launches as of the retrieval date.\n*   **Cargraze.com:** This source provides launch dates for several new cars including Mahindra XUV900, Mahindra Thar 5-Door, Mahindra BE.05 and Mahindra Scorpio N EV. This information conflicts with the launches identified in Zigwheels so is considered less reliable.\n\n**Identification of Latest Launch**\n\nBased on the available data, the **Mahindra XUV 3XO** appears to be the latest confirmed vehicle launch as of July 2025. Zigwheels lists this model with a current price range, indicating its market availability. While other sources discuss upcoming models, they are projections or expected launches rather than confirmed releases.\n\n**Features of Mahindra XUV 3XO (Based on Zigwheels Data)**\n\n*   **Price Range:** Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh (Ex-showroom)\n*   **Engine:** 1197 - 1498 CC\n*   **Mileage:** 17.96 Kmpl - 21.2 kmpl\n*   **Fuel Type:** Petrol/Diesel\n\n**Distinction Between Actual Launches and Projections**\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate between models currently available for purchase and models planned for future release. Sources like Carsandtrucks.in provide forecasts for 2025, but these are not indicative of actual launches as of the time of analysis. The Mahindra XUV 3XO, listed with a current price on Zigwheels, represents a confirmed launch, unlike the upcoming models mentioned in other sources.\n\nIn conclusion, while several new Mahindra vehicles are anticipated, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is identified as the most recent launch based on currently available data. This conclusion is based on a careful analysis of web search results, considering the credibility and context of each source.",

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Several other models are planned for launch in 2025 but have not been launched as of July 2025.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report analyzes web search results to identify the latest Mahindra vehicle launch. The primary source of information is the data retrieved in step T001, which contains snippets and URLs of web pages related to Mahindra car launches. Multiple search result entries were examined to extract relevant details and establish a timeline of recent launches.\n\n**Analysis of Search Results**\n\nThe search results point to a mix of confirmed launches, upcoming models, and facelifted versions. The key sources analyzed include Carandbike, Zigwheels, and Carsandtrucks.in. A major challenge is differentiating between announcements of future models and actual market launches.\n\n*   **Carandbike:** This source mentions upcoming Mahindra cars in 2025-2026 and includes images of models like Mahindra BE.05, XUV.e8, XUV.e9, XUV900, and Scorpio X. However, it doesn't provide specific launch dates for currently available vehicles.\n*   **Zigwheels:** This source provides a comprehensive price list of Mahindra cars as of July 2025. It lists the Mahindra XUV 3XO as one of the models with a price range of Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh. This suggests a recent or current market availability, indicating a launch date close to or before July 2025. The site also lists upcoming models like the Mahindra BE 07 and Mahindra XEV 4e but labels them as 'Upcoming Models,' clearly differentiating them from currently available cars.\n*   **Carsandtrucks.in:** This source predicts several Mahindra launches and updates for 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV/XEV 4e (expected March 2025), XEV 7e (expected March 2025), Thar 3-door Facelift (expected April 2025), and BE 07 (expected August 15, 2025). These are projections, not confirmed launches as of the retrieval date.\n*   **Cargraze.com:** This source provides launch dates for several new cars including Mahindra XUV900, Mahindra Thar 5-Door, Mahindra BE.05 and Mahindra Scorpio N EV. This information conflicts with the launches identified in Zigwheels so is considered less reliable.\n\n**Identification of Latest Launch**\n\nBased on the available data, the **Mahindra XUV 3XO** appears to be the latest confirmed vehicle launch as of July 2025. Zigwheels lists this model with a current price range, indicating its market availability. While other sources discuss upcoming models, they are projections or expected launches rather than confirmed releases.\n\n**Features of Mahindra XUV 3XO (Based on Zigwheels Data)**\n\n*   **Price Range:** Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh (Ex-showroom)\n*   **Engine:** 1197 - 1498 CC\n*   **Mileage:** 17.96 Kmpl - 21.2 kmpl\n*   **Fuel Type:** Petrol/Diesel\n\n**Distinction Between Actual Launches and Projections**\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate between models currently available for purchase and models planned for future release. Sources like Carsandtrucks.in provide forecasts for 2025, but these are not indicative of actual launches as of the time of analysis. The Mahindra XUV 3XO, listed with a current price on Zigwheels, represents a confirmed launch, unlike the upcoming models mentioned in other sources.\n\nIn conclusion, while several new Mahindra vehicles are anticipated, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is identified as the most recent launch based on currently available data. This conclusion is based on a careful analysis of web search results, considering the credibility and context of each source.",
