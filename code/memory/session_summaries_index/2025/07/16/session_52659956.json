The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

            "summary": "Based on the provided context and search results (dated July 2025), the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, is one of the most recent Mahindra car launches. While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is. NCAP, or the New Car Assessment Program, conducts crash tests to see how well a vehicle can protect its occupants in an accident. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has performed well in its NCAP tests. It was tested under Bharat NCAP (BNCAP), which is Indias version of the global safety program. The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers. All-Wheel Disc Brakes: The XUV 3XO offers disc brakes on all four wheels, providing better braking efficiency. Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3x0-achieves-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap/3665281/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://news.maxabout.com/cars/in-india-mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-full-5-star-safety-rating-in-bharat-ncap-crash-test/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://motorbridge.com/car-news/mahindra-xuv-3xo-scores-5-stars-bncap/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nine ICE-powered SUV launches also include three mid-cycle updates to existing models. In their latest investor meeting, Mahindra announced plans for its upcoming launches. The carmaker aims to launch sixteen new vehicles by 2030, including electric SUVs from their XUV and BE sub-brands. We already know the first EV, the XUV.e8, from these sub-brands is expected to be launched by December 2024. Apart from that, let's delve into what other details were revealed in the latest announcement. Nine of the upcoming sixteen launches by Mahindra will be internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered SUVs. The carmaker also mentioned that three of these will be mid-cycle updates to existing models, including the newly launched XUV 3XO. The remaining launches will include six new SUVs and seven models from its aforementioned electric sub-brands. Among the six new ICE SUVs, one is the upcoming Thar 5-door , whose launch is expected on August 15, 2024. Earlier, Mahindra also confirmed that they will electrify its entire ICE-powered vehicle lineup, including models like Scorpio , Bolero , and Thar . The brand disclosed electric powertrain specifications during the announcement, which you can check out here . We expect the XUV e8 , the EV counterpart of the XUV700 , to be launched by December 2024. It will be built on Mahindras INGLO platform that supports 60 kWh and 80 kWh battery packs. The top-spec 80 kWh battery pack can deliver a WLTP range of up to 450 km. It will join Mahindras BE range, including the BE 05 , BE 07 , and BE 09 . For more details about these models, you can refer to our earlier report here . Along with their upcoming launch plans, Mahindra also detailed their manufacturing plans. By the end of the financial year 2024-25, they aim for a monthly production capacity of 64,000 SUVs. This includes a capacity of 10,000 for EVs and an increase of 5,000 for the XUV 3XO and the soon-to-be-launched Thar 5-door.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025.

While several upcoming vehicles for 2025 are mentioned, the XUV 3XO stands out as a confirmed and relatively recent release.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe task is to identify the latest Mahindra car launch based on web search results from step T001. Analyzing the context, it's crucial to distinguish between 'upcoming' vehicles slated for future release and those that have already been launched. The timeframe is constrained to July 2025, meaning any vehicle officially available before this date qualifies as a recent launch.\n\nThe search results from T001 contain multiple articles, each presenting a mix of launched and planned vehicles. A key source of ambiguity arises from phrases like 'upcoming cars in 2025,' making it imperative to differentiate between projections and actual releases.\n\nThe strongest contender for a recent launch is the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Several articles, including those from ZigWheels and CarDekho, discuss this model. However, the exact launch date within the context of July 2025 needs clarification. These articles suggest a launch date in early 2024, placing it well within the scope of being a 'recent launch'.\n\nExamining individual search results:\n\n1.  **carandbike.com:** The article titled 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars in India' focuses primarily on vehicles planned for 2025-2026. These include models like the Mahindra BE.05 and XUV.e8. As these are future projections, they don't qualify as recent launches.\n\n2.  **ZigWheels.com:** The article 'Mahindra Confirms 16 New Launches By 2030' provides a broader roadmap. While it mentions the XUV 3XO and upcoming EVs like the XUV e8, the XUV 3XO is the more immediate release, with the XUV e8 expected by the end of 2024 (prior to July 2025). The article highlights Mahindra's aim to launch sixteen vehicles, including nine ICE-powered SUVs and seven electric models, but doesn't specifically detail launches after early 2024.\n\n3.  **carsandtrucks.in:** The article 'Upcoming Mahindra Cars to Watch Out for in 2025' lists several vehicles expected in 2025, including the XUV 4XO EV, XEV 7e, and Thar 3-door Facelift. Because these are labeled as 'expected' rather than 'launched,' they are less relevant to the immediate query.\n\n4.  **CarDekho.com:** The article 'Here Are All The Mahindra Cars To Watch Out For In 2025' mirrors the others, highlighting expected vehicles like the XUV 4XO EV and XEV 7e. The article notes Mahindra's plans to introduce new models in its 'XEV' and 'BE' lineup, but it predominantly discusses future releases.\n\n5.  **91wheels.com:** This article provides a price list for upcoming Mahindra cars in India for 2025-2026. The list contains models like the XUV900 Electric, BE Rall-E, and XUV 3XO EV, all with 'expected launch' dates. This reinforces the focus on projected launches rather than concrete releases.\n\nTo strengthen the recommendation, it is essential to consider any feature updates or trim level launches that might qualify as 'recent launches' even if the base model has been available for some time. However, the available search results do not offer definitive insights into this aspect. Thus, the recommendation is primarily based on identifying the latest entirely new vehicle launch.\n\nGiven this context, the Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in early 2024, remains the most substantiated and confirmed recent launch within the search results. While several upcoming vehicles are mentioned for 2025, their status as projected releases limits their suitability for the current recommendation.",

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.
