However, it is facing tough competition from the likes of Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors in the UV space. Determined to regain lost ground in the segment, Mahindra had introduced multiple new SUVs including the new Thar, XUV700 and the Scorpio-N. In order to further strengthen its position in the UV segment, Mahindra plans to launch a range of new SUVs in the next 2-3 years. Heres a look at all upcoming Mahindra cars in India in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Upcoming Mahindra Cars in 2023, 2024, 2025 1. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Mahindra is all set to introduce the extended version of the Bolero Neo in the country. Called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is likely to be offered with two seating configurations 7 and 9-seats. It will also be offered with an ambulance variant with 4-seats layout and a patient bed. In terms of proportions, the SUV is 4400mm long, 1795mm wide and 1812mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2680mm. The new model looks largely identical to the Bolero Neo; however, it received some changes to keep things fresh. Instead of a blacked-out C-pillar, it has body-coloured pillars. It gets new rear bumper and smaller reflector panels, a tailgate-mounted spare tyre with badging and extended rear door. The SUV will be powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine with a 6-speed manual gearbox. This powertrain produces 130PS and 300Nm of torque. 2. 5-door Mahindra Thar The next model in our list of upcoming Mahindra cars is the 5-door or long wheelbase version of the Mahindra Thar. It is expected to be launched by the end of 2023 or early 2024. The 5-door Mahindra Thar will have 300mm longer wheelbase than its 3-door model. It is expected to be based on the new Scorpio-Ns ladder-frame chassis with increased width between the wheelbase for bettery wheelbase-to-track ratio. The SUV will have an extra door for the middle row passengers. The cabin layout will be similar to the existing model and will have a three seat bench layout in the middle row and provide bigger boot space. The SUV is expected to share its powertrains with the Scorpio N. It will be offered with a 200bhp, 2.0L turbo petrol and a 172bhp, 2.2L turbo diesel engine. It can be had with either a manual or an automatic gearbox. 3. New-gen Mahindra Bolero Mahindra will launch the next gen Bolero in our market in 2024. The SUV enjoys huge popularity among buyers in rural and semi-urban markets. It is reportedly to be based on the new ladder-frame chassis that underpins the Thar and the Scorpio-N. The new model is likely to retain the original look; however, it will come with several new design elements and body panels. The cabin will receive maximum changes with better fit & finish levels and material quality. It could also get some modern day features like a touchscreen infotainment system, a multi-functional steering wheel, height adjustable drivers seat and automatic AC. The SUV is likely to feature a 2.2L mHawk diesel and a 2.0L turbo petrol engine along with manual and automatic gearbox options. 4.

Here are the top five Mahindra SUV and electric vehicle launches expected in India. Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

            "summary": "The Mahindra XUV300 Facelift, launched in February 2024, is provisionally recommended based on available information. Further research on customer reviews and detailed specifications is required for a conclusive assessment.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the information retrieved, several Mahindra models were slated for launch in 2023 and 2024. The analysis focuses on identifying the 'latest' vehicle from this list, considering the limited availability of detailed specifications, customer reviews, and concrete launch dates. \n\n**Key Models and Launch Timelines:**\n\n*   **Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus:** Initially expected in December 2022, this model's launch seems to have been pushed to 2024. It is an extended version of the Bolero Neo with 7 and 9-seater configurations, powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine. A key feature is its versatility, catering to larger families and potentially commercial applications.\n*   **Mahindra XUV400 EV:** The electric variant was expected in January 2023, aiming to compete in the rapidly growing EV market. This model would feature a powertrain suitable for city driving. The facelifted version is expected in the second half of 2024 with similar features to the XUV300 Facelift.\n*   **Mahindra New XUV500:** Expected in July 2024, it is positioned between the XUV300 and XUV700, featuring significant design updates. The focus is on a more compact SUV with advanced features including ADAS.\n*   **Mahindra 5-door Thar:** Anticipated since 2023 and into 2024, the 5-door Thar is a long-wheelbase version, offering increased practicality with additional doors and boot space. It is expected to share powertrains with the Scorpio N, providing both petrol and diesel options with manual and automatic gearboxes. It aims to blend off-road capability with everyday usability.\n*   **Mahindra Bolero (New Generation):** Projected for November 2024, this new-gen Bolero is built on the ladder-frame chassis of the Thar and Scorpio-N. The update includes new design elements, improved interiors, and modern features such as a touchscreen infotainment system. The key feature is maintaining the Bolero's rugged appeal while adding modern comforts.\n*   **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift:** Launched in February 2024, the XUV300 Facelift features a redesigned front and rear fascia, a larger touchscreen infotainment system, and cutting-edge connectivity capabilities. The panoramic sunroof enhances the overall appeal. This is powered by 1.2 L MPI Turbo-Petrol, 1.2 L TGDI Petrol, and 1.5 L Turbo Diesel engines.\n*    **Mahindra XUV300 EV:** Expected in the second half of 2024, the XUV300 EV will likely get a 35-kWh battery pack with an expected range of 400+ kilometres on a single charge. This is placed below the XUV400.\n*    **Mahindra Thar Armada:** Expected in the second half of 2024, this is based on the ladder frame chassis with similar design language to the three-door Thar. It will have redesigned dashboard with a larger touchscreen infotainment system and an electric sunroof. Two Engine Options: 2.0 L MStallion Turbo-Petrol and 2.2 L MHawk Diesel.\n*    **Mahindra XUV.e8:** Expected at the end of 2024, this is the all-electric version of the XUV700. The electric SUV is expected to be offered with two battery pack options, ranging from 60 kWh to 80 kWh, along with the availability of a dual-motor all-wheel drivetrain. \n*   **Mahindra XUV400 Facelift:** Expected launch in the second half of 2024, this updated EV is expected to come with an improved range while retaining its existing 34.5 kWh and 39.4 kWh battery pack options that could offer better range.\n\n**Recommendation and Justification:**\n\nBased on the available launch timelines, the **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift**, launched in February 2024, appears to be the most recent vehicle launch. Its features include a redesigned exterior, updated interior, advanced connectivity options, and multiple engine choices, making it a competitive option in the sub-4m SUV segment. However, the lack of detailed customer reviews and a comprehensive market analysis necessitates further investigation before a conclusive recommendation can be made. \n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThe analysis is limited by the incomplete nature of the information provided. The 'upcoming' nature of most models means actual launch dates and real-world performance data are not readily available. A full recommendation would require:\n\n*   **Confirmed launch dates** for each model.\n*   **Detailed specifications** for all vehicles, including engine performance, safety features, and available trim levels.\n*   **Customer reviews** and initial market reception to gauge real-world performance and reliability.\n*   **Comparative analysis** against competitor vehicles in each segment.\n*   **Market position analysis** to understand each model's target audience and competitive advantages.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nProvisionally, the Mahindra XUV300 Facelift is recommended as the latest vehicle launch. However, a comprehensive evaluation involving the collection of the data gaps as highlighted is imperative to provide a robust and conclusive recommendation. Subsequent steps are needed to analyse customer review and create comparative analysis tables with competitor products.",

Heres a look at all upcoming Mahindra cars in India in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Upcoming Mahindra Cars in 2023, 2024, 2025 1.

Called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is likely to be offered with two seating configurations 7 and 9-seats. It will also be offered with an ambulance variant with 4-seats layout and a patient bed. In terms of proportions, the SUV is 4400mm long, 1795mm wide and 1812mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2680mm. The new model looks largely identical to the Bolero Neo; however, it received some changes to keep things fresh. Instead of a blacked-out C-pillar, it has body-coloured pillars. It gets new rear bumper and smaller reflector panels, a tailgate-mounted spare tyre with badging and extended rear door.

It is expected to be launched by the end of 2023 or early 2024. The 5-door Mahindra Thar will have 300mm longer wheelbase than its 3-door model. It is expected to be based on the new Scorpio-Ns ladder-frame chassis with increased width between the wheelbase for bettery wheelbase-to-track ratio. The SUV will have an extra door for the middle row passengers. The cabin layout will be similar to the existing model and will have a three seat bench layout in the middle row and provide bigger boot space. The SUV is expected to share its powertrains with the Scorpio N. It will be offered with a 200bhp, 2.0L turbo petrol and a 172bhp, 2.2L turbo diesel engine. It can be had with either a manual or an automatic gearbox. 3. New-gen Mahindra Bolero Mahindra will launch the next gen Bolero in our market in 2024. The SUV enjoys huge popularity among buyers in rural and semi-urban markets. It is reportedly to be based on the new ladder-frame chassis that underpins the Thar and the Scorpio-N. The new model is likely to retain the original look; however, it will come with several new design elements and body panels. The cabin will receive maximum changes with better fit & finish levels and material quality. It could also get some modern day features like a touchscreen infotainment system, a multi-functional steering wheel, height adjustable drivers seat and automatic AC. The SUV is likely to feature a 2.2L mHawk diesel and a 2.0L turbo petrol engine along with manual and automatic gearbox options. 4.

Here are the top five Mahindra SUV and electric vehicle launches expected in India. Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

Here are the top five Mahindra SUV and electric vehicle launches expected in India. Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the information retrieved, several Mahindra models were slated for launch in 2023 and 2024. The analysis focuses on identifying the 'latest' vehicle from this list, considering the limited availability of detailed specifications, customer reviews, and concrete launch dates. \n\n**Key Models and Launch Timelines:**\n\n*   **Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus:** Initially expected in December 2022, this model's launch seems to have been pushed to 2024. It is an extended version of the Bolero Neo with 7 and 9-seater configurations, powered by a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine. A key feature is its versatility, catering to larger families and potentially commercial applications.\n*   **Mahindra XUV400 EV:** The electric variant was expected in January 2023, aiming to compete in the rapidly growing EV market. This model would feature a powertrain suitable for city driving. The facelifted version is expected in the second half of 2024 with similar features to the XUV300 Facelift.\n*   **Mahindra New XUV500:** Expected in July 2024, it is positioned between the XUV300 and XUV700, featuring significant design updates. The focus is on a more compact SUV with advanced features including ADAS.\n*   **Mahindra 5-door Thar:** Anticipated since 2023 and into 2024, the 5-door Thar is a long-wheelbase version, offering increased practicality with additional doors and boot space. It is expected to share powertrains with the Scorpio N, providing both petrol and diesel options with manual and automatic gearboxes. It aims to blend off-road capability with everyday usability.\n*   **Mahindra Bolero (New Generation):** Projected for November 2024, this new-gen Bolero is built on the ladder-frame chassis of the Thar and Scorpio-N. The update includes new design elements, improved interiors, and modern features such as a touchscreen infotainment system. The key feature is maintaining the Bolero's rugged appeal while adding modern comforts.\n*   **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift:** Launched in February 2024, the XUV300 Facelift features a redesigned front and rear fascia, a larger touchscreen infotainment system, and cutting-edge connectivity capabilities. The panoramic sunroof enhances the overall appeal. This is powered by 1.2 L MPI Turbo-Petrol, 1.2 L TGDI Petrol, and 1.5 L Turbo Diesel engines.\n*    **Mahindra XUV300 EV:** Expected in the second half of 2024, the XUV300 EV will likely get a 35-kWh battery pack with an expected range of 400+ kilometres on a single charge. This is placed below the XUV400.\n*    **Mahindra Thar Armada:** Expected in the second half of 2024, this is based on the ladder frame chassis with similar design language to the three-door Thar. It will have redesigned dashboard with a larger touchscreen infotainment system and an electric sunroof. Two Engine Options: 2.0 L MStallion Turbo-Petrol and 2.2 L MHawk Diesel.\n*    **Mahindra XUV.e8:** Expected at the end of 2024, this is the all-electric version of the XUV700. The electric SUV is expected to be offered with two battery pack options, ranging from 60 kWh to 80 kWh, along with the availability of a dual-motor all-wheel drivetrain. \n*   **Mahindra XUV400 Facelift:** Expected launch in the second half of 2024, this updated EV is expected to come with an improved range while retaining its existing 34.5 kWh and 39.4 kWh battery pack options that could offer better range.\n\n**Recommendation and Justification:**\n\nBased on the available launch timelines, the **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift**, launched in February 2024, appears to be the most recent vehicle launch. Its features include a redesigned exterior, updated interior, advanced connectivity options, and multiple engine choices, making it a competitive option in the sub-4m SUV segment. However, the lack of detailed customer reviews and a comprehensive market analysis necessitates further investigation before a conclusive recommendation can be made. \n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThe analysis is limited by the incomplete nature of the information provided. The 'upcoming' nature of most models means actual launch dates and real-world performance data are not readily available. A full recommendation would require:\n\n*   **Confirmed launch dates** for each model.\n*   **Detailed specifications** for all vehicles, including engine performance, safety features, and available trim levels.\n*   **Customer reviews** and initial market reception to gauge real-world performance and reliability.\n*   **Comparative analysis** against competitor vehicles in each segment.\n*   **Market position analysis** to understand each model's target audience and competitive advantages.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nProvisionally, the Mahindra XUV300 Facelift is recommended as the latest vehicle launch. However, a comprehensive evaluation involving the collection of the data gaps as highlighted is imperative to provide a robust and conclusive recommendation. Subsequent steps are needed to analyse customer review and create comparative analysis tables with competitor products.",

It is expected to feature ADAS tech and other interior upgrades. The new XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. <a href='https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/top-5-upcoming-mahindra-vehicle-launches/2991432/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[2]</a></p><h3>Mahindra XUV300 Facelift</h3><p>Launched in February 2024, the XUV300 Facelift features a redesigned front and rear fascia, a larger touchscreen infotainment system, and new connectivity capabilities.
