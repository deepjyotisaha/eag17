ANA offers potentially convenient direct options but without explicit schedules in provided data.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report analyzes flight options from Delhi (DEL) to Tokyo (NRT) based on the data retrieved from web searches. The primary goal is to identify the cheapest, fastest, and most convenient options, considering factors such as airline, flight number, departure and arrival times, layover duration and location, and price.\n\n**Data Sources:**\nThe analysis is based on search results including ANA's official website, MakeMyTrip, JAL's website, FlightRoutes.com, Via.com, FlightConnections.com, and Skyscanner. The FlightRoutes.com data appears to be the most structured for comparing routes, while ANA provides pricing information.\n\n**Analysis by Criteria:**\n\n*   **Cheapest Options:**\n    *   Based on the information from ANA, fares start from INR 39,800 for certain periods. However, this needs direct verification.\n    *   FlightRoutes.com suggests Thai AirAsia X with a layover in Bangkok (DMK) may be economical. Further investigation is needed to confirm prices.\n    *   Nepal Airlines, with a layover in Kathmandu (KTM), could be another budget-friendly option.\n*   **Fastest Options:**\n    *   Cathay Pacific, via Hong Kong (HKG), offers a flight duration of approximately 11 hours and 35 minutes.\n    *   Air India and Biman Bangladesh Airlines, via Dhaka (DAC), offer flights around 11 hours and 25 minutes.\n*   **Most Convenient Options:**\n    *   ANA direct flights are potentially the most convenient, but specific schedules are not extracted in the provided data. Direct flights eliminate layover hassles, which many travelers prefer.\n    *   If direct flights are not available or too expensive, the next convenient option might be flights with shorter layovers in transit hubs with good facilities (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong).\n\n**Detailed Flight Options:**\n\nThe following table summarizes available flight options.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report analyzes flight options from Delhi (DEL) to Tokyo (NRT) based on the data retrieved from web searches. The primary goal is to identify the cheapest, fastest, and most convenient options, considering factors such as airline, flight number, departure and arrival times, layover duration and location, and price.\n\n**Data Sources:**\nThe analysis is based on search results including ANA's official website, MakeMyTrip, JAL's website, FlightRoutes.com, Via.com, FlightConnections.com, and Skyscanner. The FlightRoutes.com data appears to be the most structured for comparing routes, while ANA provides pricing information.\n\n**Analysis by Criteria:**\n\n*   **Cheapest Options:**\n    *   Based on the information from ANA, fares start from INR 39,800 for certain periods. However, this needs direct verification.\n    *   FlightRoutes.com suggests Thai AirAsia X with a layover in Bangkok (DMK) may be economical. Further investigation is needed to confirm prices.\n    *   Nepal Airlines, with a layover in Kathmandu (KTM), could be another budget-friendly option.\n*   **Fastest Options:**\n    *   Cathay Pacific, via Hong Kong (HKG), offers a flight duration of approximately 11 hours and 35 minutes.\n    *   Air India and Biman Bangladesh Airlines, via Dhaka (DAC), offer flights around 11 hours and 25 minutes.\n*   **Most Convenient Options:**\n    *   ANA direct flights are potentially the most convenient, but specific schedules are not extracted in the provided data. Direct flights eliminate layover hassles, which many travelers prefer.\n    *   If direct flights are not available or too expensive, the next convenient option might be flights with shorter layovers in transit hubs with good facilities (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong).\n\n**Detailed Flight Options:**\n\nThe following table summarizes available flight options.

          "reasoning": "I have formatted the flight options data into a comprehensive HTML report with multiple sections including an executive summary, detailed flight options table, risks, recommendations, and key factors considered. The report is structured to provide a clear and concise analysis for an executive audience.  Since there were no images available, I did not include an image section. I will call self again as there are many sections where the text is under 100 words, and I can likely find more data within all_globals_schema to augment.",
