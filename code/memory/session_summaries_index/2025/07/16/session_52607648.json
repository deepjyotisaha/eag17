Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is. NCAP, or the New Car Assessment Program, conducts crash tests to see how well a vehicle can protect its occupants in an accident. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has performed well in its NCAP tests. It was tested under Bharat NCAP (BNCAP), which is Indias version of the global safety program. The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers. All-Wheel Disc Brakes: The XUV 3XO offers disc brakes on all four wheels, providing better braking efficiency. Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/file-ezgif.com-resize-1-1160x653-1-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Black Hyundai Verna', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-516876 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-amc-Library/default/dw14bf6b46/X3XO/XUV3XOProductBrochure-01-07-24.pdf', 'content': '[no text]', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carblogindia.com/mahindra-xuv3xos-safety-rating-ncap/', 'content': 'What is Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating at NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?
