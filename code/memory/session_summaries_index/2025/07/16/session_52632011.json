However, a quick look at the rivals' features set reveals that the XUV 3XO lacks a few amenities that the other offerings in the sub-compact segment have. Here is a list of such features: Ventilated Seats Given the tropical climate means warm to humid weather in most conditions across the majority of the states. So, seat ventilation in cars is a good-to-have benefit, which many cars are now provided with. While most subcompact SUVs have front and rear AC vents, the ventilated seats are what distinguish the XUV 3XOs rivals. The Kia Sonet and Tata Nexon have ventilated front seats, although limited to their top-spec variants. Paddle Shifters In a world where creature comforts are becoming increasingly important, paddle shifters have become an essential component of an automatic transmission. Despite having a torque converter gearbox, the Mahindra XUV 3XO lacks paddle shifters. In comparison, the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue , and Tata Nexon all have paddle shifters in their automatic variants. Heads-up Display A heads-up display (HUD) allows drivers to keep their eyes on the road by displaying critical information directly in their line of sight, reducing the need to look away or down at other devices, minimising distraction, and increasing situational awareness. The Mahindra XUV 3XO, like its competitors, except the Maruti Brezza , lacks this feature. Powered Drivers Seat One of the most useful comfort and convenience features on a car is the provision of a powered driver seat. The benefit of using an electronic adjustment is that it allows for better, more refined, and specific adjustments. In the sub-compact SUV segment, the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, and Tata Nexon all have this feature, but the XUV 3XO does not. Air Purifier We all know how the air quality levels in India keep varying from state to state during different times of the year. One of the ways to deal with it while being in your car is by having an air purifier. This feature was previously available in a lot of premium cars, following which it has trickled down to more affordable models. Although the XUV 3XO doesnt get it, its rivals such as the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, and Tata Nexon have this feature. What feature from this list do you think should have made it to the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Tell us in the comments.

Home News 5 Features Missing On The Mahindra XUV 3X0 5 Features Missing On The Mahindra XUV 3X0 Published 1 year ago on                 May 5, 2024 By Nachiket Bhole Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Mahindra has surprised everyone with the launch of the all new Mahindra XUV 3XO. The SUV gets all new design and features. Moreover, what has really impressed everyone is the pricing of the 3XO. The XUV 3XO has been priced between Rs 8.61 lakh to Rs 18.12 lakh (on-road, Mumbai). That said, even with all the bells and whistles in the new XUV 3XO, the SUV misses out on 5 factors which the competitors offer you. So if those 5 elements matter to you the most, the XUV 3XO could not be the one for you! Attention Readers! Join us on Whatsapp Community for daily auto news updates. Before we get into nit-picking the negatives on the Mahindra XUV 3X0, here are 5 things only the XUV 3X0 offers Panoramic Sunroof Largest sunroof in its segment and better than cars one segment higher. Dual-zone AC Only car to offer this luxury feature on the budget. ADAS Level 2 ADAS with both radar and camera. Premium feature as SUVs one segment higher offer camera based ADAS. 17-inch alloy wheels Only car in its segment to offer 17-inch wheels. Larger cars like Maruti Grand Vitara and Hyundai Creta are other cars that offer 17-inch wheels. Most Powerful Engine At 130 bhp and diesel torque of 300 Nm, the XUV 3X0 smashes competition. The new model is more powerful than most compact SUVs at this budget. XUV 3XO Missing Features Ventilated Seats Although the XUV 3XO is a feature loaded car, the SUV misses out on one of the most common features, ventilated seats. It might not be an exclusive feature but with the increase in the temperature, ventilated seats are a boon to have in a car. So if you want this feature in your compact SUV, Tata Nexon and Kia Sonet are the ones to go for. Also Read: Indias Cheapest Fully Automatic SUV Is Here! XUV 3XO Missing Features Powered Seat Next, the XUV 3XO also misses on powered seats, again, something which should not really matter to you. That said, having a powered seat feature is always convenient for you. Talking about the competition, the Hyundai Venue, and the Kia Sonet, both the SUVs get powered driver seats. Paddle Shifters The new XUV 3XO comes with a powerful 1.2-litre TGDi engine, mated with a 6-speed torque converter gearbox. However, the SUV does not get paddle shifters which we feel could have enhanced the fun to drive quotient. That said, all the other competing SUVs get this feature with turbo petrol engines. The Venue, Sonet and the Nexon, gets paddle shifters with DCT transmission. Whereas the Maruti Brezza gets them with its petrol automatic combination. Also Read Mahindra XUV 3XO Launched XUV700 On A Budget? Heads-up Display Another feature which could have been offered on the Mahindra XUV 3XO is head-up display. It is an exclusive feature which is offered only in the Maruti Brezza. Yes, it is not a deal breaker feature but having one in a car surely adds to the sense of convenience. XUV 3XO Missing Features CNG Option Finally, lack of CNG options could be a major miss for many. Currently, we only have the Maruti Brezza which comes with an option for CNG. Whereas in the near future, even the Tata Nexon will get CNG with its 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine. In such a case, Tata and Maruti will have an upper hand over the XUV 3XO with the option of CNG powertrain. So if you are looking for a CNG powered compact SUV, the XUV 3XO will not fulfil your requirements. If you have car buying doubts click here to ask!

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Variants Available: This panoramic sunroof is available with the AX7 and the AX7 L trim onwards at a starting price point of Rs. 12.49 lakhs.

Its key strengths include powerful engine options, a feature-rich interior, and a 5-star NCAP rating.

Successful mitigation will require aggressive marketing highlighting unique strengths, service improvements, and flexible supply chain management. Quantifying these risks is challenging without detailed sales forecasts and market analysis, however, these risks should be monitored and addressed proactively to ensure long-term success. The impact of the missing features like ventilated seats could be mitigated through aftermarket options or future model updates.</p></div><div class='hidden-signals-and-meta-observations'><h2 id='hidden-signals-and-meta-observations'>🕵️ Hidden Signals and Meta Observations</h2><blockquote>The strong emphasis on safety features (5-star NCAP, Level 2 ADAS) suggests Mahindra is targeting safety-conscious buyers.</blockquote><blockquote>The inclusion of segment-first features like steering modes and electronic parking brake indicates an attempt to offer a premium experience.</blockquote><blockquote>However, the omission of popular features like ventilated seats raises questions about market research and feature prioritization.</blockquote><blockquote>The availability of Level 2 ADAS from AX5 Luxury trim onwards indicates that Mahindra is democratizing advanced safety features, making them accessible to a wider range of buyers.</blockquote><blockquote>The continuous updates and REVX series launch suggest Mahindra is actively listening to customer feedback and trying to stay competitive.</blockquote></div><div class='technology-breakdown'><h2 id='technology-breakdown'> 💻 Technology Breakdown</h2><p>The Mahindra XUV 3XO incorporates several advanced technologies:</p><ul><li><b>Level 2 ADAS:</b> Includes features like forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, and traffic sign recognition. <a href='https://www.91wheels.com/expert-review/mahindra-xuv-3xo-key-features-explained-what-makes-it-stand-out' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[3]</a></li><li><b>Fully Digital Instrument Cluster:</b> A 10.25-inch unit displays essential drive-related stats. <a href='https://www.91wheels.com/expert-review/mahindra-xuv-3xo-key-features-explained-what-makes-it-stand-out' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[3]</a></li><li><b>Steering Modes:</b> Offers different steering feedback based on driving style (sport, normal, comfort). <a href='https://www.91wheels.com/expert-review/mahindra-xuv-3xo-key-features-explained-what-makes-it-stand-out' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[3]</a></li><li><b>Electronic Parking Brake:</b> Available with auto hold feature. <a href='https://www.91wheels.com/expert-review/mahindra-xuv-3xo-key-features-explained-what-makes-it-stand-out' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[3]</a></li><li><b>Harman Kardon Audio System:</b> Provides a premium audio experience. <a href='https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[2]</a></li><li><b>Wireless Smartphone Connectivity:</b> Enables seamless integration of smartphones with the infotainment system. <a href='https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[2]</a></li><li><b>360-degree camera:</b> Provides a comprehensive view of the vehicle's surroundings, aiding in parking and maneuvering in tight spaces. <a href='https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[2]</a></li></ul></div><div class='specification-details'><h2 id='specification-details'> 📏 Specification Details</h2><p>Detailed specifications of the Mahindra XUV 3XO include:</p><ul><li><b>Engine Options:</b> Petrol and Diesel</li><li><b>Engine Power:</b> Up to 130 bhp</li><li><b>Torque:</b> Up to 300 Nm</li><li><b>Transmission:</b> 6-speed torque converter automatic, AMT</li><li><b>Seating Capacity:</b> 5</li><li><b>Boot Space:</b> 295 liters</li><li><b>Safety:</b> 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS</li><li><b>Infotainment:</b> 10.25-inch touchscreen, Harman Kardon audio system</li><li><b>Other Features:</b> Panoramic sunroof, Level 2 ADAS, steering modes, electronic parking brake</li></ul></div><div class='source-citations'><h2 id='source-citations'>📜 Source Citations</h2><ol><li><a href='https://motoroctane.com/news/272132-5-features-missing-on-the-mahindra-xuv-3x0' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>MotorOctane article on missing features</a></li><li><a href='https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Team-BHP review of the Mahindra XUV 3XO</a></li><li><a href='https://www.91wheels.com/expert-review/mahindra-xuv-3xo-key-features-explained-what-makes-it-stand-out' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>91Wheels article on key features</a></li></ol></div><div class='final-highlights-and-recommendations'><h2 id='final-highlights-and-recommendations'>✨ Final Highlights and Recommendations</h2><p>The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a promising subcompact SUV with a refreshed design, powerful engine options, and a feature-rich interior.

However, a quick look at the rivals' features set reveals that the XUV 3XO lacks a few amenities that the other offerings in the sub-compact segment have. Here is a list of such features: Ventilated Seats Given the tropical climate means warm to humid weather in most conditions across the majority of the states. So, seat ventilation in cars is a good-to-have benefit, which many cars are now provided with. While most subcompact SUVs have front and rear AC vents, the ventilated seats are what distinguish the XUV 3XOs rivals. The Kia Sonet and Tata Nexon have ventilated front seats, although limited to their top-spec variants. Paddle Shifters In a world where creature comforts are becoming increasingly important, paddle shifters have become an essential component of an automatic transmission. Despite having a torque converter gearbox, the Mahindra XUV 3XO lacks paddle shifters. In comparison, the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue , and Tata Nexon all have paddle shifters in their automatic variants. Heads-up Display A heads-up display (HUD) allows drivers to keep their eyes on the road by displaying critical information directly in their line of sight, reducing the need to look away or down at other devices, minimising distraction, and increasing situational awareness. The Mahindra XUV 3XO, like its competitors, except the Maruti Brezza , lacks this feature. Powered Drivers Seat One of the most useful comfort and convenience features on a car is the provision of a powered driver seat. The benefit of using an electronic adjustment is that it allows for better, more refined, and specific adjustments. In the sub-compact SUV segment, the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, and Tata Nexon all have this feature, but the XUV 3XO does not. Air Purifier We all know how the air quality levels in India keep varying from state to state during different times of the year. One of the ways to deal with it while being in your car is by having an air purifier. This feature was previously available in a lot of premium cars, following which it has trickled down to more affordable models. Although the XUV 3XO doesnt get it, its rivals such as the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, and Tata Nexon have this feature. What feature from this list do you think should have made it to the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Tell us in the comments.

That said, even with all the bells and whistles in the new XUV 3XO, the SUV misses out on 5 factors which the competitors offer you. So if those 5 elements matter to you the most, the XUV 3XO could not be the one for you! Attention Readers! Join us on Whatsapp Community for daily auto news updates. Before we get into nit-picking the negatives on the Mahindra XUV 3X0, here are 5 things only the XUV 3X0 offers Panoramic Sunroof Largest sunroof in its segment and better than cars one segment higher. Dual-zone AC Only car to offer this luxury feature on the budget. ADAS Level 2 ADAS with both radar and camera. Premium feature as SUVs one segment higher offer camera based ADAS. 17-inch alloy wheels Only car in its segment to offer 17-inch wheels. Larger cars like Maruti Grand Vitara and Hyundai Creta are other cars that offer 17-inch wheels. Most Powerful Engine At 130 bhp and diesel torque of 300 Nm, the XUV 3X0 smashes competition. The new model is more powerful than most compact SUVs at this budget. XUV 3XO Missing Features Ventilated Seats Although the XUV 3XO is a feature loaded car, the SUV misses out on one of the most common features, ventilated seats. It might not be an exclusive feature but with the increase in the temperature, ventilated seats are a boon to have in a car. So if you want this feature in your compact SUV, Tata Nexon and Kia Sonet are the ones to go for. Also Read: Indias Cheapest Fully Automatic SUV Is Here! XUV 3XO Missing Features Powered Seat Next, the XUV 3XO also misses on powered seats, again, something which should not really matter to you. That said, having a powered seat feature is always convenient for you. Talking about the competition, the Hyundai Venue, and the Kia Sonet, both the SUVs get powered driver seats. Paddle Shifters The new XUV 3XO comes with a powerful 1.2-litre TGDi engine, mated with a 6-speed torque converter gearbox. However, the SUV does not get paddle shifters which we feel could have enhanced the fun to drive quotient. That said, all the other competing SUVs get this feature with turbo petrol engines. The Venue, Sonet and the Nexon, gets paddle shifters with DCT transmission. Whereas the Maruti Brezza gets them with its petrol automatic combination.

It is an exclusive feature which is offered only in the Maruti Brezza. Yes, it is not a deal breaker feature but having one in a car surely adds to the sense of convenience. XUV 3XO Missing Features CNG Option Finally, lack of CNG options could be a major miss for many. Currently, we only have the Maruti Brezza which comes with an option for CNG. Whereas in the near future, even the Tata Nexon will get CNG with its 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine. In such a case, Tata and Maruti will have an upper hand over the XUV 3XO with the option of CNG powertrain. So if you are looking for a CNG powered compact SUV, the XUV 3XO will not fulfil your requirements. If you have car buying doubts click here to ask!

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,879 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

However, a quick look at the rivals' features set reveals that the XUV 3XO lacks a few amenities that the other offerings in the sub-compact segment have. Here is a list of such features: Ventilated Seats Given the tropical climate means warm to humid weather in most conditions across the majority of the states. So, seat ventilation in cars is a good-to-have benefit, which many cars are now provided with. While most subcompact SUVs have front and rear AC vents, the ventilated seats are what distinguish the XUV 3XOs rivals. The Kia Sonet and Tata Nexon have ventilated front seats, although limited to their top-spec variants. Paddle Shifters In a world where creature comforts are becoming increasingly important, paddle shifters have become an essential component of an automatic transmission. Despite having a torque converter gearbox, the Mahindra XUV 3XO lacks paddle shifters. In comparison, the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue , and Tata Nexon all have paddle shifters in their automatic variants. Heads-up Display A heads-up display (HUD) allows drivers to keep their eyes on the road by displaying critical information directly in their line of sight, reducing the need to look away or down at other devices, minimising distraction, and increasing situational awareness. The Mahindra XUV 3XO, like its competitors, except the Maruti Brezza , lacks this feature. Powered Drivers Seat One of the most useful comfort and convenience features on a car is the provision of a powered driver seat. The benefit of using an electronic adjustment is that it allows for better, more refined, and specific adjustments. In the sub-compact SUV segment, the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, and Tata Nexon all have this feature, but the XUV 3XO does not. Air Purifier We all know how the air quality levels in India keep varying from state to state during different times of the year. One of the ways to deal with it while being in your car is by having an air purifier. This feature was previously available in a lot of premium cars, following which it has trickled down to more affordable models. Although the XUV 3XO doesnt get it, its rivals such as the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, and Tata Nexon have this feature. What feature from this list do you think should have made it to the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Tell us in the comments.

Home News 5 Features Missing On The Mahindra XUV 3X0 5 Features Missing On The Mahindra XUV 3X0 Published 1 year ago on                 May 5, 2024 By Nachiket Bhole Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Mahindra has surprised everyone with the launch of the all new Mahindra XUV 3XO. The SUV gets all new design and features. Moreover, what has really impressed everyone is the pricing of the 3XO. The XUV 3XO has been priced between Rs 8.61 lakh to Rs 18.12 lakh (on-road, Mumbai). That said, even with all the bells and whistles in the new XUV 3XO, the SUV misses out on 5 factors which the competitors offer you. So if those 5 elements matter to you the most, the XUV 3XO could not be the one for you! Attention Readers! Join us on Whatsapp Community for daily auto news updates. Before we get into nit-picking the negatives on the Mahindra XUV 3X0, here are 5 things only the XUV 3X0 offers Panoramic Sunroof Largest sunroof in its segment and better than cars one segment higher. Dual-zone AC Only car to offer this luxury feature on the budget. ADAS Level 2 ADAS with both radar and camera. Premium feature as SUVs one segment higher offer camera based ADAS. 17-inch alloy wheels Only car in its segment to offer 17-inch wheels. Larger cars like Maruti Grand Vitara and Hyundai Creta are other cars that offer 17-inch wheels. Most Powerful Engine At 130 bhp and diesel torque of 300 Nm, the XUV 3X0 smashes competition. The new model is more powerful than most compact SUVs at this budget. XUV 3XO Missing Features Ventilated Seats Although the XUV 3XO is a feature loaded car, the SUV misses out on one of the most common features, ventilated seats. It might not be an exclusive feature but with the increase in the temperature, ventilated seats are a boon to have in a car. So if you want this feature in your compact SUV, Tata Nexon and Kia Sonet are the ones to go for. Also Read: Indias Cheapest Fully Automatic SUV Is Here! XUV 3XO Missing Features Powered Seat Next, the XUV 3XO also misses on powered seats, again, something which should not really matter to you. That said, having a powered seat feature is always convenient for you. Talking about the competition, the Hyundai Venue, and the Kia Sonet, both the SUVs get powered driver seats. Paddle Shifters The new XUV 3XO comes with a powerful 1.2-litre TGDi engine, mated with a 6-speed torque converter gearbox. However, the SUV does not get paddle shifters which we feel could have enhanced the fun to drive quotient. That said, all the other competing SUVs get this feature with turbo petrol engines. The Venue, Sonet and the Nexon, gets paddle shifters with DCT transmission. Whereas the Maruti Brezza gets them with its petrol automatic combination. Also Read Mahindra XUV 3XO Launched XUV700 On A Budget? Heads-up Display Another feature which could have been offered on the Mahindra XUV 3XO is head-up display. It is an exclusive feature which is offered only in the Maruti Brezza. Yes, it is not a deal breaker feature but having one in a car surely adds to the sense of convenience. XUV 3XO Missing Features CNG Option Finally, lack of CNG options could be a major miss for many. Currently, we only have the Maruti Brezza which comes with an option for CNG. Whereas in the near future, even the Tata Nexon will get CNG with its 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine. In such a case, Tata and Maruti will have an upper hand over the XUV 3XO with the option of CNG powertrain. So if you are looking for a CNG powered compact SUV, the XUV 3XO will not fulfil your requirements. If you have car buying doubts click here to ask!

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Variants Available: This panoramic sunroof is available with the AX7 and the AX7 L trim onwards at a starting price point of Rs. 12.49 lakhs.
