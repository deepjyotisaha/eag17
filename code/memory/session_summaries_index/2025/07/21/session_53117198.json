Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India.

Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/car-reviews/driving-impressions/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': 'Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Secondary Menu News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals News Latest Motoring news Industry news New models Speed Rumours Videos Reviews Road tests Driving impressions Buying used cars Buy a Car New Cars For Sale Cheap Cars For Sale Used Cars For Sale Demo Cars For Sale Bakkies For Sale Bikes For Sale Elite Cars SUVs Under R300 000 Electric Cars South Africa Leisure Wheels Tools Car Valuation Car Insurance Quote Sell your car Compare Cars Locate Dealer Natis Online Booking Car Dealer Price Guide Parts & Accessories Deals One Day Deals Nationwide Deals Deals in Cape Town Deals in Johannesburg Deals in Durban Deals in Pretoria Deals in Port Elizabeth Accommodation Deals Romantic Getaways Food and Drink Deals Experiences Health and Wellness Deals Home > Car reviews > Driving Impressions > Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra XUV 3XO - 1/3 2/3 3/3 Driving Impressions Posted November 16, 2024 By: Ian McLaren From humble beginnings, the Mahindra Group has become one of the largest enterprises in India. Together with a first drive of its newest product, we explore the ambitions of this powerhouse brands automotive division. Looking for a new or used set of wheels? Find it here with CARmag! Mahindra XUV 3XO 1.2T AX7L AT Fast Facts Price R404 999 Engine 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbopetrol Power 82 kW @ 5000 r/min Torque 200 N.m @ 1500 3500 r/min Transmission 6-speed automatic Fuel consumption 6.5 L/100 km Emissions 137 g/km Although Mahindra & Mahindra was established in 1945, it was a collaborative deal three years later to assemble the Willys CJ-3B Jeep in Mumbai that realised a watershed moment in the fortunes of the family-run business. By all accounts, still utilising the Jeep formula with its modern Thar products, another collaboration, this time in 1963, with US agricultural powerhouse International Harvester proved to be the catalyst for Mahindra currently producing the best-selling tractor in the world by volume. Run by Anand Mahindra the grandson of one of the founding brothers since 2012, this spirit of considered collaboration has continued to serve one of Indias largest enterprises well. Broadly acknowledged as a crowning moment in Mahindras shift towards targeting the SUV market starting with India it was then-new-to-the-automotive division Anands bold decision to seek out expertise from around the globe. Harnessing what it had learned in terms of quality and production processes while working closely with Ford, Mahindra would introduce the first Scorpio in 2002. Priced well, particularly in its home market, and with an associated marketing campaign that highlighted the lifestyle qualities of this product, to date, the Scorpio badge including the second-generation Scorpio-N that impressed us in our July 2024 SUV Shootout has accounted for more than 1 million sales on Mahindras books. In 2019, another significant moment in Mahindras automotive ambitions arrived in South Africa in the form of the XUV300. Another product born of a globally connected collaboration, this time with Korean brand SsangYong, yet significantly re-engineered to suit the Indian market (including a sub-four-metre profile and a revised suspension), our August 2019 test of the flagship W8 model described its arrival as Mahindras Getz moment, referring to the model that s', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-40-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ferrari 328 GTS driving', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carmag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-33-400x240.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Audi A3 Sportback Black Edition front', 'width': '400', 'height': '240', 'class': 'attachment-car-thumbnail size-car-thumbnail wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-locate-dealer.png', 'alt_text': 'Locate Dealer', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.carmag.co.za/wp-content/themes/CarMag_Revamp/images/carmag-car-compare.png', 'alt_text': 'Car Compare', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://auto.mahindra.com/suv/xuv3xo/X3XO.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.bookmycar.co.in/new-cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,211 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV300, XUV 3XO review, design, interior, features, performance, first drive - Introduction | Autocar India All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos All All Price News Reviews Features Specifications Images Videos Signup Login Find a Car Cars Compare Cars New Cars Upcoming Cars Car Price Car Loan Calculator Find a Bike Bikes Compare Bikes New New Bikes New Scooters Upcoming Upcoming Bikes Upcoming Scooters Electric Electric Bikes Electric Scooters Bike Price Bike Loan Calculator News Cars Bikes Motorsports Industry Marketplace Reviews Car First drive / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Bike First ride / Reviews Comparisons Video reviews Long-term reviews Features Features Travelogues Blogs Interviews Partner Content Galleries Videos Images Stories Advice Signup Login Home Car Reviews Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV Out goes the Mahindra XUV300 and in comes the XUV 3XO.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested).

For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India.

Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested).
