The shift towards sustainability has led to a significant rise in the production and sales of electric and hybrid luxury SUVs. Luxury SUVs are at the forefront of automotive technology, integrating features such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving capabilities, and state-of-the-art infotainment systems. Furthermore, the rising demand for advanced safety features within SUVs to minimize accidents is further driving the demand for the market over the forecast period.

Luxury vehicles incorporate advanced technologies and premium features that distinguish them from even the most comprehensively equipped commuter SUVs. The perception of luxury SUVs as premium products is significantly shaped by advertisements that emphasize their superior attributes and enhance the buyer's social status. Consequently, automakers equip luxury SUV models with state-of-the-art technologies, as these vehicles serve as a representation of the company's brand identity. Moreover, luxury SUVs provide superior safety and security for occupants. With the increasing frequency of traffic accidents, the demand for advanced safety features in luxury vehicles is projected to grow, further enhancing their appeal to potential buyers. Moreover, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) integrate the features of passenger vehicles with off-road capabilities. Technological advancements have greatly diversified the luxury SUV market, providing a broad range of options. Modern luxury SUVs come equipped with advanced powertrains and state-of-the-art safety, infotainment, and connectivity systems. Larger than standard vehicles, SUVs enhance driving security while offering spacious interiors with two or three rows of seating. Additionally, they provide the cargo versatility of pickup trucks, making them ideal for transporting various types of loads. Luxury SUV Market Trends Consumer preferences are increasingly favoring luxury SUV brands, driven by rising disposable incomes and the enhanced luxury features offered by automobiles. In response to growing environmental concerns, governments and environmental organizations worldwide are implementing stricter emission standards. This has resulted in a rising demand for sustainable transportation solutions, particularly electric luxury vehicles. Additionally, the market is expanding due to the increasing adoption of used luxury vehicles, supported by easier financing options, reduced initial costs, and annual maintenance agreements. Furthermore, leading manufacturers are driving market growth by integrating advanced smart mobility technologies, such as retina recognition, autonomous driving, and personal voice assistance. For instance, in August 2024, BYD partnered with Huawei to integrate advanced autonomous driving technology into its upcoming Fangchengbao luxury SUV lineup, specifically the Bao 8 model. This collaboration aims to enhance BYD's competitive edge in the premium electric vehicle market. The Bao 8 will feature Huawei's Qiankun intelligent driving system, which is designed to improve safety and driving performance. This system is part of Huawei's broader strategy to establish itself as a key player in the automotive sector, particularly in autonomous driving technology. The substantial cost of luxury SUVs, driven by advanced technologies, premium materials, superior craftsmanship, and brand value, restricts their accessibility to a niche customer segment. This pricing strategy primarily targets affluent buyers, thereby limiting the overall customer base. In emerging economies, high import duties and taxes further escalate prices, making these vehicles even less attainable. Additionally, ongoing expenses such as maintenance, insurance premiums, and fuel costs significantly increase the total cost of ownership, disc\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Research Report', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-by-fuel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-revenue-share-by-sales-channel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/china-luxury-suv-market-size-2025-2034..webp', 'alt_text': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-company-market-share-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-luxury-car-market', 'content': 'North America Luxury Car Market Size, Share Analysis & Trends, 2030 Reports Aerospace & Defense Agriculture Animal Nutrition & Wellness Automotive Chemicals & Materials Consumer Goods and Services Energy & Power Financial Services and Investment Intelligence Food & Beverage Healthcare Home and Property Improvement Hospitality and Tourism Logistics Manufacturing Products and Services Packaging Professional and Commercial Services Real Estate and Construction Retail Technology, Media and Telecom Custom Research About Our People Our Clients FAQs Subscription Careers Contact +1 617-765-2493 North America Luxury Car Market Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends & Forecasts (2025 - 2030) The North America Market Report is Segmented by Vehicle Type (Sedan, SUV/Crossover, and More), Drive Type (Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Battery-Electric, and More), Price Band (Premium 50k100k USD, Upper-Premium 100k200k USD, and More), Sales Channel (Franchised Dealer, Direct-To-Consumer, and More), and Country (United States, Canada, and More).

View Global Report Select Another Geography Asia China Europe India North America Luxury Car Market Analysis by Mordor Intelligence The North America luxury car market size is valued at USD 52.33 billion in 2025 and is projected to advance to USD 82.05 billion by 2030, translating into a 9.41% CAGR. The expansion rests on a generational shift as wealth moves to millennials and Gen-Z, who place a higher weight on digital integration, electrification, and responsible sourcing. Luxury nameplates are launching SUV-heavy portfolios, enlarging average selling prices, and protecting margins even as financing costs rise. The pivot toward battery-electric nameplates, spurred by Canadian purchase incentives and stricter fleet-emission rules, further elevates demand for premium EVs. Supply-side investments in localized battery packs, coupled with over-the-air upgrade revenues, allow automakers to absorb raw-material volatility while keeping profit pools attractive. Meanwhile, digital retail channels build relevance among affluent digital natives, accelerating a wider move away from exclusive reliance on franchised dealers.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) Read Team-BHP's detailed Mahindra XUV 3XO Review View Forum Discussion Tags: Indian Mahindra Launches & Updates Mahindra XUV 3XO Back to Index Next Article Related News Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX edition launch soon; details revealed Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX Series launched at Rs 8.94 lakh 10,000 km with my Mahindra XUV 3X0: Service & ownership recap Booked Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 over Skoda Kylaq Signature Plus: Here's why Improving my Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5L's audio setup with a 2-stage upgrade Find Car News By Brand Any Brand Audi BMW BYD Chevrolet Citroen Datsun Ferrari Fiat Force Ford HM Honda Hyundai Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lotus Mahindra Maruti Suzuki McLaren Mercedes-Benz MG Mini Mitsubishi Nissan Porsche Premier Renault Rolls-Royce Skoda Tata Tesla Toyota VinFast Volkswagen Volvo Or By Category Any Category 2-Wheels Commercial Vehicles Industry & Policy Launches & Updates Member Content Motorsports Other Sales & Analysis Scoops & Rumours Just News 1,800 Skoda & VW sedans and SUVs recalled over seatbelt issue Stephane Deblaise appointed CEO of Renault Group India MG M9 electric MPV launched at Rs 70 lakh Hyundai Creta completes 10 years in India; 12 lakh units sold India-bound 2026 Renault Kwid EV spotted in Brazil Kinetic DX electric scooter teased ahead of launch Mahindra XUV700 surpasses the 3 lakh unit sales milestone GM files patent for system that predicts road deterioration JLR delays launch of new Range Rover Electric & Jaguar EVs 2025 Tata Harrier.ev : Observations after a day of driving 2025 Tata Harrier.ev Review : 10 Pros & 9 Cons Porsche Taycan 4S Black Edition launched at Rs 2.07 crore Team-BHP.com Advice Classifieds Forum Hot Threads News Photos Reviews Road Safety Store Tech Stuff About Us Overview The Team Key Features Philosophy History Contact Us Speak Share Advertise Copyright 2025 - www.team-bhp.com Site Map | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions Team-BHP's Daily Newsletter View recent samples Tata Harrier.ev Buy & Sell USED CARS Rs. 2 Lakhs or less Rs. 2 - 4 Lakhs Rs. 4 - 6 Lakhs Rs. 6 - 8 Lakhs Rs. 8 Lakhs or mor\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_20.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_27.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_thumb_review_detail/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carfolio.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo-823691', 'content': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO: detailed specifications, performance and economy data 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a suv/sports utility vehicle with 5 doors and a front mounted engine which supplies its power to the front wheels.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

GMI6011 | Published Date: January 2025 | Report Format: PDF Download Free PDF Summary Table of Contents Luxury SUV Market Size The global luxury SUV market size was valued at USD 8.7 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.8% between 2025 and 2034. Luxury vehicles incorporate advanced technologies and premium features that distinguish them from even the most comprehensively equipped commuter SUVs. The perception of luxury SUVs as premium products is significantly shaped by advertisements that emphasize their superior attributes and enhance the buyer's social status. Consequently, automakers equip luxury SUV models with state-of-the-art technologies, as these vehicles serve as a representation of the company's brand identity. Moreover, luxury SUVs provide superior safety and security for occupants. With the increasing frequency of traffic accidents, the demand for advanced safety features in luxury vehicles is projected to grow, further enhancing their appeal to potential buyers. Moreover, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) integrate the features of passenger vehicles with off-road capabilities. Technological advancements have greatly diversified the luxury SUV market, providing a broad range of options. Modern luxury SUVs come equipped with advanced powertrains and state-of-the-art safety, infotainment, and connectivity systems. Larger than standard vehicles, SUVs enhance driving security while offering spacious interiors with two or three rows of seating. Additionally, they provide the cargo versatility of pickup trucks, making them ideal for transporting various types of loads. Luxury SUV Market Trends Consumer preferences are increasingly favoring luxury SUV brands, driven by rising disposable incomes and the enhanced luxury features offered by automobiles. In response to growing environmental concerns, governments and environmental organizations worldwide are implementing stricter emission standards. This has resulted in a rising demand for sustainable transportation solutions, particularly electric luxury vehicles. Additionally, the market is expanding due to the increasing adoption of used luxury vehicles, supported by easier financing options, reduced initial costs, and annual maintenance agreements. Furthermore, leading manufacturers are driving market growth by integrating advanced smart mobility technologies, such as retina recognition, autonomous driving, and personal voice assistance. For instance, in August 2024, BYD partnered with Huawei to integrate advanced autonomous driving technology into its upcoming Fangchengbao luxury SUV lineup, specifically the Bao 8 model. This collaboration aims to enhance BYD's competitive edge in the premium electric vehicle market. The Bao 8 will feature Huawei's Qiankun intelligent driving system, which is designed to improve safety and driving performance. This system is part of Huawei's broader strategy to establish itself as a key player in the automotive sector, particularly in autonomous driving technology. The substantial cost of luxury SUVs, driven by advanced technologies, premium materials, superior craftsmanship, and brand value, restricts their accessibility to a niche customer segment. This pricing strategy primarily targets affluent buyers, thereby limiting the overall customer base. In emerging economies, high import duties and taxes further escalate prices, making these vehicles even less attainable. Additionally, ongoing expenses such as maintenance, insurance premiums, and fuel costs significantly increase the total cost of ownership, disc\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Research Report', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-by-fuel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-revenue-share-by-sales-channel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/china-luxury-suv-market-size-2025-2034..webp', 'alt_text': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-company-market-share-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/mid-size-suv-market-21598', 'content': 'Mid-Size SUV Market Size, Share, Trends, Growth Report 2034  Industry Expertise Healthcare Life Science Medical Device Pharmaceutical Healthcare It Healthcare Services Chemicals And Materials Mining Advanced Materials AgroChemicals Basic Chemicals Metals & Alloys Polymers & Plastics Renewable Chemicals Speciality Chemicals Information And Communication Technology Ai And Analytics Cloud IoT And M2M Communication It Security Networking And Telecommunications Service Software Technology Semiconductor & Electronics Sensor And Control Test And Measurement Silion, Wafer And Fabrication Security, Access Control And Robotics Chipset And Processors Consumer Electronic Devices Camera, Display And Lighting Energy And Power Renewable Energy Industrial Motors, Pumps And Control Devices Driling, Intervention And Completion Batteries Offshore Oil And Gas Power Generation, Transmission And Distribution Food, Beverage & Nutrition Automobile Automotive Components Off Road Vehicles, Lcv, Hcv Telematics And Infotainment Ice, Electric, Hybrid, Autonomous Vehicles Bikes And Motorcycle Railway Tires And Wheels Automotive Technology, Services BFSI Consumer And Retail Aerospace & Defense Industrial Automation & Equipment Packaging & Transport Construction Agriculture Cat-Intel MedIntellix Consulting Services Strategic Consulting Granular Research Customer Acquisition Our Publications Syndicate Reports Category Intelligence News Insights Infographics Press Releases Articles Case Studies Videos Blogs About Us About MRFR Our Team Careers Contact Us Media Citation Testimonials Login info@marketresearchfuture.com +1 (855) 661-4441(US) +44 1720 412 167(UK) Search Certified Global Research Member Key Questions Answered Global Market Outlook In-depth analysis of global and regional trends Analyze and identify the major players in the market, their market share, key developments, etc. To understand the capability of the major players based on products offered, financials, and strategies.

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/ev-market-analysis/', 'content': 'Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Report Store Visit Corporate Site Sign In Menu Report Store Sign in Home Reports View all Reports Reports by Sector Aerospace and Defense Agriculture and Forestry Apparel Automotive Business and Consumer Services Chemicals Construction Consumer COVID-19 Financial Services Foodservice Government and Non-Profit Organisations Industrial Goods and Machinery Medical Devices Mining Oil and Gas Packaging Pharmaceuticals Power Retail Sport Technology Telecommunications Transportation, Infrastructure and Logistics Travel and Tourism Report Type Company Profile Track & Monitor Sector Analysis Product Insights Analyst Opinions Company Insights Thematic Analysis Case Studies Visit Corporate Site Search our Database Trending: Ukraine Crisis Briefing Inflation COVID-19 Sustainability Tesla Netflix Vaccine Home Reports Current: Automotive Current: Future Mobility Current: CASE Current: Electrification Current: Electrified Vehicles 2628041 1 Standard Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Powered by All the vital news, analysis, and commentary curated by our industry experts. $3995 Buy Report Download FREE Resources Published: December 30, 2024 Report Code: GDAE1229MAR-ST Share Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Threads Share via Email Copy Link Select Item Report Overview Key Players Table of Contents Table Figures Electric Vehicles Market Report, Update 2024 Global Market Outlook, Trends, and Key Country Analysis is the latest market analysis report from GlobalData, the industry analysis specialist.

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/ev-market-analysis/', 'content': 'Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Report Store Visit Corporate Site Sign In Menu Report Store Sign in Home Reports View all Reports Reports by Sector Aerospace and Defense Agriculture and Forestry Apparel Automotive Business and Consumer Services Chemicals Construction Consumer COVID-19 Financial Services Foodservice Government and Non-Profit Organisations Industrial Goods and Machinery Medical Devices Mining Oil and Gas Packaging Pharmaceuticals Power Retail Sport Technology Telecommunications Transportation, Infrastructure and Logistics Travel and Tourism Report Type Company Profile Track & Monitor Sector Analysis Product Insights Analyst Opinions Company Insights Thematic Analysis Case Studies Visit Corporate Site Search our Database Trending: Ukraine Crisis Briefing Inflation COVID-19 Sustainability Tesla Netflix Vaccine Home Reports Current: Automotive Current: Future Mobility Current: CASE Current: Electrification Current: Electrified Vehicles 2628041 1 Standard Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Powered by All the vital news, analysis, and commentary curated by our industry experts. $3995 Buy Report Download FREE Resources Published: December 30, 2024 Report Code: GDAE1229MAR-ST Share Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Threads Share via Email Copy Link Select Item Report Overview Key Players Table of Contents Table Figures Electric Vehicles Market Report, Update 2024 Global Market Outlook, Trends, and Key Country Analysis is the latest market analysis report from GlobalData, the industry analysis specialist.

The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies.

Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles.

In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s. Autonomous SUVs are anticipated to witness growth Autonomous SUVs are projected to grow significantly during the forecast due to the rising demand for safety, comfort, and driving convenience features.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.qyresearch.com/reports/2147614/suv', 'content': 'Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 - QYResearch Industry Research Reports Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Home > Reports > Automobile & Transportation > Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 Industry: Automobile & Transportation Published: 2024-01-05 Pages: 96 Pages Report ld: 2147614 Request Sample Pre-Order Enquiry Description Table of Contents Table of Figures Related Reports PDF Download Description Table of Contents Table of Figures Related Reports PDF Download Description SUV is an automotive classification, typically a kind of station wagon/estate car with off-road vehicle features like raised ground clearance and ruggedness, and available four-wheel drive.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) Read Team-BHP's detailed Mahindra XUV 3XO Review View Forum Discussion Tags: Indian Mahindra Launches & Updates Mahindra XUV 3XO Back to Index Next Article Related News Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX edition launch soon; details revealed Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX Series launched at Rs 8.94 lakh 10,000 km with my Mahindra XUV 3X0: Service & ownership recap Booked Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 over Skoda Kylaq Signature Plus: Here's why Improving my Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5L's audio setup with a 2-stage upgrade Find Car News By Brand Any Brand Audi BMW BYD Chevrolet Citroen Datsun Ferrari Fiat Force Ford HM Honda Hyundai Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lotus Mahindra Maruti Suzuki McLaren Mercedes-Benz MG Mini Mitsubishi Nissan Porsche Premier Renault Rolls-Royce Skoda Tata Tesla Toyota VinFast Volkswagen Volvo Or By Category Any Category 2-Wheels Commercial Vehicles Industry & Policy Launches & Updates Member Content Motorsports Other Sales & Analysis Scoops & Rumours Just News 1,800 Skoda & VW sedans and SUVs recalled over seatbelt issue Stephane Deblaise appointed CEO of Renault Group India MG M9 electric MPV launched at Rs 70 lakh Hyundai Creta completes 10 years in India; 12 lakh units sold India-bound 2026 Renault Kwid EV spotted in Brazil Kinetic DX electric scooter teased ahead of launch Mahindra XUV700 surpasses the 3 lakh unit sales milestone GM files patent for system that predicts road deterioration JLR delays launch of new Range Rover Electric & Jaguar EVs 2025 Tata Harrier.ev : Observations after a day of driving 2025 Tata Harrier.ev Review : 10 Pros & 9 Cons Porsche Taycan 4S Black Edition launched at Rs 2.07 crore Team-BHP.com Advice Classifieds Forum Hot Threads News Photos Reviews Road Safety Store Tech Stuff About Us Overview The Team Key Features Philosophy History Contact Us Speak Share Advertise Copyright 2025 - www.team-bhp.com Site Map | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions Team-BHP's Daily Newsletter View recent samples Tata Harrier.ev Buy & Sell USED CARS Rs. 2 Lakhs or less Rs. 2 - 4 Lakhs Rs. 4 - 6 Lakhs Rs. 6 - 8 Lakhs Rs. 8 Lakhs or mor\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_20.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_27.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_thumb_review_detail/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carfolio.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo-823691', 'content': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO: detailed specifications, performance and economy data 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a suv/sports utility vehicle with 5 doors and a front mounted engine which supplies its power to the front wheels.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) Read Team-BHP's detailed Mahindra XUV 3XO Review View Forum Discussion Tags: Indian Mahindra Launches & Updates Mahindra XUV 3XO Back to Index Next Article Related News Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX edition launch soon; details revealed Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX Series launched at Rs 8.94 lakh 10,000 km with my Mahindra XUV 3X0: Service & ownership recap Booked Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 over Skoda Kylaq Signature Plus: Here's why Improving my Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5L's audio setup with a 2-stage upgrade Find Car News By Brand Any Brand Audi BMW BYD Chevrolet Citroen Datsun Ferrari Fiat Force Ford HM Honda Hyundai Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lotus Mahindra Maruti Suzuki McLaren Mercedes-Benz MG Mini Mitsubishi Nissan Porsche Premier Renault Rolls-Royce Skoda Tata Tesla Toyota VinFast Volkswagen Volvo Or By Category Any Category 2-Wheels Commercial Vehicles Industry & Policy Launches & Updates Member Content Motorsports Other Sales & Analysis Scoops & Rumours Just News 1,800 Skoda & VW sedans and SUVs recalled over seatbelt issue Stephane Deblaise appointed CEO of Renault Group India MG M9 electric MPV launched at Rs 70 lakh Hyundai Creta completes 10 years in India; 12 lakh units sold India-bound 2026 Renault Kwid EV spotted in Brazil Kinetic DX electric scooter teased ahead of launch Mahindra XUV700 surpasses the 3 lakh unit sales milestone GM files patent for system that predicts road deterioration JLR delays launch of new Range Rover Electric & Jaguar EVs 2025 Tata Harrier.ev : Observations after a day of driving 2025 Tata Harrier.ev Review : 10 Pros & 9 Cons Porsche Taycan 4S Black Edition launched at Rs 2.07 crore Team-BHP.com Advice Classifieds Forum Hot Threads News Photos Reviews Road Safety Store Tech Stuff About Us Overview The Team Key Features Philosophy History Contact Us Speak Share Advertise Copyright 2025 - www.team-bhp.com Site Map | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions Team-BHP's Daily Newsletter View recent samples Tata Harrier.ev Buy & Sell USED CARS Rs. 2 Lakhs or less Rs. 2 - 4 Lakhs Rs. 4 - 6 Lakhs Rs. 6 - 8 Lakhs Rs. 8 Lakhs or mor\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_20.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_27.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_thumb_review_detail/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carfolio.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo-823691', 'content': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO: detailed specifications, performance and economy data 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a suv/sports utility vehicle with 5 doors and a front mounted engine which supplies its power to the front wheels.

The shift towards sustainability has led to a significant rise in the production and sales of electric and hybrid luxury SUVs. Luxury SUVs are at the forefront of automotive technology, integrating features such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving capabilities, and state-of-the-art infotainment systems. Furthermore, the rising demand for advanced safety features within SUVs to minimize accidents is further driving the demand for the market over the forecast period.

Luxury vehicles incorporate advanced technologies and premium features that distinguish them from even the most comprehensively equipped commuter SUVs. The perception of luxury SUVs as premium products is significantly shaped by advertisements that emphasize their superior attributes and enhance the buyer's social status. Consequently, automakers equip luxury SUV models with state-of-the-art technologies, as these vehicles serve as a representation of the company's brand identity. Moreover, luxury SUVs provide superior safety and security for occupants. With the increasing frequency of traffic accidents, the demand for advanced safety features in luxury vehicles is projected to grow, further enhancing their appeal to potential buyers. Moreover, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) integrate the features of passenger vehicles with off-road capabilities. Technological advancements have greatly diversified the luxury SUV market, providing a broad range of options. Modern luxury SUVs come equipped with advanced powertrains and state-of-the-art safety, infotainment, and connectivity systems. Larger than standard vehicles, SUVs enhance driving security while offering spacious interiors with two or three rows of seating. Additionally, they provide the cargo versatility of pickup trucks, making them ideal for transporting various types of loads. Luxury SUV Market Trends Consumer preferences are increasingly favoring luxury SUV brands, driven by rising disposable incomes and the enhanced luxury features offered by automobiles. In response to growing environmental concerns, governments and environmental organizations worldwide are implementing stricter emission standards. This has resulted in a rising demand for sustainable transportation solutions, particularly electric luxury vehicles. Additionally, the market is expanding due to the increasing adoption of used luxury vehicles, supported by easier financing options, reduced initial costs, and annual maintenance agreements. Furthermore, leading manufacturers are driving market growth by integrating advanced smart mobility technologies, such as retina recognition, autonomous driving, and personal voice assistance. For instance, in August 2024, BYD partnered with Huawei to integrate advanced autonomous driving technology into its upcoming Fangchengbao luxury SUV lineup, specifically the Bao 8 model. This collaboration aims to enhance BYD's competitive edge in the premium electric vehicle market. The Bao 8 will feature Huawei's Qiankun intelligent driving system, which is designed to improve safety and driving performance. This system is part of Huawei's broader strategy to establish itself as a key player in the automotive sector, particularly in autonomous driving technology. The substantial cost of luxury SUVs, driven by advanced technologies, premium materials, superior craftsmanship, and brand value, restricts their accessibility to a niche customer segment. This pricing strategy primarily targets affluent buyers, thereby limiting the overall customer base. In emerging economies, high import duties and taxes further escalate prices, making these vehicles even less attainable. Additionally, ongoing expenses such as maintenance, insurance premiums, and fuel costs significantly increase the total cost of ownership, disc\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Research Report', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-by-fuel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-revenue-share-by-sales-channel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/china-luxury-suv-market-size-2025-2034..webp', 'alt_text': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-company-market-share-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-luxury-car-market', 'content': 'North America Luxury Car Market Size, Share Analysis & Trends, 2030 Reports Aerospace & Defense Agriculture Animal Nutrition & Wellness Automotive Chemicals & Materials Consumer Goods and Services Energy & Power Financial Services and Investment Intelligence Food & Beverage Healthcare Home and Property Improvement Hospitality and Tourism Logistics Manufacturing Products and Services Packaging Professional and Commercial Services Real Estate and Construction Retail Technology, Media and Telecom Custom Research About Our People Our Clients FAQs Subscription Careers Contact +1 617-765-2493 North America Luxury Car Market Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends & Forecasts (2025 - 2030) The North America Market Report is Segmented by Vehicle Type (Sedan, SUV/Crossover, and More), Drive Type (Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Battery-Electric, and More), Price Band (Premium 50k100k USD, Upper-Premium 100k200k USD, and More), Sales Channel (Franchised Dealer, Direct-To-Consumer, and More), and Country (United States, Canada, and More).

View Global Report Select Another Geography Asia China Europe India North America Luxury Car Market Analysis by Mordor Intelligence The North America luxury car market size is valued at USD 52.33 billion in 2025 and is projected to advance to USD 82.05 billion by 2030, translating into a 9.41% CAGR. The expansion rests on a generational shift as wealth moves to millennials and Gen-Z, who place a higher weight on digital integration, electrification, and responsible sourcing. Luxury nameplates are launching SUV-heavy portfolios, enlarging average selling prices, and protecting margins even as financing costs rise. The pivot toward battery-electric nameplates, spurred by Canadian purchase incentives and stricter fleet-emission rules, further elevates demand for premium EVs. Supply-side investments in localized battery packs, coupled with over-the-air upgrade revenues, allow automakers to absorb raw-material volatility while keeping profit pools attractive. Meanwhile, digital retail channels build relevance among affluent digital natives, accelerating a wider move away from exclusive reliance on franchised dealers.

By drive type, battery-electric vehicles will post the fastest growth at an 11.04% CAGR, whereas internal-combustion engines retained 65.33% share of the North America luxury car market size in 2024. By price band, the premium tier (USD 50,000-100,000) accounted for 42.05% of the North America luxury car market size in 2024; the upper-premium tier (USD 100,000-200,000) is projected to expand at 12.24% CAGR to 2030.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) Read Team-BHP's detailed Mahindra XUV 3XO Review View Forum Discussion Tags: Indian Mahindra Launches & Updates Mahindra XUV 3XO Back to Index Next Article Related News Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX edition launch soon; details revealed Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX Series launched at Rs 8.94 lakh 10,000 km with my Mahindra XUV 3X0: Service & ownership recap Booked Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 over Skoda Kylaq Signature Plus: Here's why Improving my Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5L's audio setup with a 2-stage upgrade Find Car News By Brand Any Brand Audi BMW BYD Chevrolet Citroen Datsun Ferrari Fiat Force Ford HM Honda Hyundai Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lotus Mahindra Maruti Suzuki McLaren Mercedes-Benz MG Mini Mitsubishi Nissan Porsche Premier Renault Rolls-Royce Skoda Tata Tesla Toyota VinFast Volkswagen Volvo Or By Category Any Category 2-Wheels Commercial Vehicles Industry & Policy Launches & Updates Member Content Motorsports Other Sales & Analysis Scoops & Rumours Just News 1,800 Skoda & VW sedans and SUVs recalled over seatbelt issue Stephane Deblaise appointed CEO of Renault Group India MG M9 electric MPV launched at Rs 70 lakh Hyundai Creta completes 10 years in India; 12 lakh units sold India-bound 2026 Renault Kwid EV spotted in Brazil Kinetic DX electric scooter teased ahead of launch Mahindra XUV700 surpasses the 3 lakh unit sales milestone GM files patent for system that predicts road deterioration JLR delays launch of new Range Rover Electric & Jaguar EVs 2025 Tata Harrier.ev : Observations after a day of driving 2025 Tata Harrier.ev Review : 10 Pros & 9 Cons Porsche Taycan 4S Black Edition launched at Rs 2.07 crore Team-BHP.com Advice Classifieds Forum Hot Threads News Photos Reviews Road Safety Store Tech Stuff About Us Overview The Team Key Features Philosophy History Contact Us Speak Share Advertise Copyright 2025 - www.team-bhp.com Site Map | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions Team-BHP's Daily Newsletter View recent samples Tata Harrier.ev Buy & Sell USED CARS Rs. 2 Lakhs or less Rs. 2 - 4 Lakhs Rs. 4 - 6 Lakhs Rs. 6 - 8 Lakhs Rs. 8 Lakhs or mor\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_20.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_extra_large_for_review/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_interior_27.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/sites/default/files/styles/check_thumb_review_detail/public/2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01_0.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carfolio.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo-823691', 'content': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO: detailed specifications, performance and economy data 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a suv/sports utility vehicle with 5 doors and a front mounted engine which supplies its power to the front wheels.

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/ev-market-analysis/', 'content': 'Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Report Store Visit Corporate Site Sign In Menu Report Store Sign in Home Reports View all Reports Reports by Sector Aerospace and Defense Agriculture and Forestry Apparel Automotive Business and Consumer Services Chemicals Construction Consumer COVID-19 Financial Services Foodservice Government and Non-Profit Organisations Industrial Goods and Machinery Medical Devices Mining Oil and Gas Packaging Pharmaceuticals Power Retail Sport Technology Telecommunications Transportation, Infrastructure and Logistics Travel and Tourism Report Type Company Profile Track & Monitor Sector Analysis Product Insights Analyst Opinions Company Insights Thematic Analysis Case Studies Visit Corporate Site Search our Database Trending: Ukraine Crisis Briefing Inflation COVID-19 Sustainability Tesla Netflix Vaccine Home Reports Current: Automotive Current: Future Mobility Current: CASE Current: Electrification Current: Electrified Vehicles 2628041 1 Standard Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Powered by All the vital news, analysis, and commentary curated by our industry experts. $3995 Buy Report Download FREE Resources Published: December 30, 2024 Report Code: GDAE1229MAR-ST Share Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Threads Share via Email Copy Link Select Item Report Overview Key Players Table of Contents Table Figures Electric Vehicles Market Report, Update 2024 Global Market Outlook, Trends, and Key Country Analysis is the latest market analysis report from GlobalData, the industry analysis specialist.

Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/ev-market-analysis/', 'content': 'Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Report Store Visit Corporate Site Sign In Menu Report Store Sign in Home Reports View all Reports Reports by Sector Aerospace and Defense Agriculture and Forestry Apparel Automotive Business and Consumer Services Chemicals Construction Consumer COVID-19 Financial Services Foodservice Government and Non-Profit Organisations Industrial Goods and Machinery Medical Devices Mining Oil and Gas Packaging Pharmaceuticals Power Retail Sport Technology Telecommunications Transportation, Infrastructure and Logistics Travel and Tourism Report Type Company Profile Track & Monitor Sector Analysis Product Insights Analyst Opinions Company Insights Thematic Analysis Case Studies Visit Corporate Site Search our Database Trending: Ukraine Crisis Briefing Inflation COVID-19 Sustainability Tesla Netflix Vaccine Home Reports Current: Automotive Current: Future Mobility Current: CASE Current: Electrification Current: Electrified Vehicles 2628041 1 Standard Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Powered by All the vital news, analysis, and commentary curated by our industry experts. $3995 Buy Report Download FREE Resources Published: December 30, 2024 Report Code: GDAE1229MAR-ST Share Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Threads Share via Email Copy Link Select Item Report Overview Key Players Table of Contents Table Figures Electric Vehicles Market Report, Update 2024 Global Market Outlook, Trends, and Key Country Analysis is the latest market analysis report from GlobalData, the industry analysis specialist.

GMI6011 | Published Date: January 2025 | Report Format: PDF Download Free PDF Summary Table of Contents Luxury SUV Market Size The global luxury SUV market size was valued at USD 8.7 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.8% between 2025 and 2034. Luxury vehicles incorporate advanced technologies and premium features that distinguish them from even the most comprehensively equipped commuter SUVs. The perception of luxury SUVs as premium products is significantly shaped by advertisements that emphasize their superior attributes and enhance the buyer's social status. Consequently, automakers equip luxury SUV models with state-of-the-art technologies, as these vehicles serve as a representation of the company's brand identity. Moreover, luxury SUVs provide superior safety and security for occupants. With the increasing frequency of traffic accidents, the demand for advanced safety features in luxury vehicles is projected to grow, further enhancing their appeal to potential buyers. Moreover, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) integrate the features of passenger vehicles with off-road capabilities. Technological advancements have greatly diversified the luxury SUV market, providing a broad range of options. Modern luxury SUVs come equipped with advanced powertrains and state-of-the-art safety, infotainment, and connectivity systems. Larger than standard vehicles, SUVs enhance driving security while offering spacious interiors with two or three rows of seating. Additionally, they provide the cargo versatility of pickup trucks, making them ideal for transporting various types of loads. Luxury SUV Market Trends Consumer preferences are increasingly favoring luxury SUV brands, driven by rising disposable incomes and the enhanced luxury features offered by automobiles. In response to growing environmental concerns, governments and environmental organizations worldwide are implementing stricter emission standards. This has resulted in a rising demand for sustainable transportation solutions, particularly electric luxury vehicles. Additionally, the market is expanding due to the increasing adoption of used luxury vehicles, supported by easier financing options, reduced initial costs, and annual maintenance agreements. Furthermore, leading manufacturers are driving market growth by integrating advanced smart mobility technologies, such as retina recognition, autonomous driving, and personal voice assistance. For instance, in August 2024, BYD partnered with Huawei to integrate advanced autonomous driving technology into its upcoming Fangchengbao luxury SUV lineup, specifically the Bao 8 model. This collaboration aims to enhance BYD's competitive edge in the premium electric vehicle market. The Bao 8 will feature Huawei's Qiankun intelligent driving system, which is designed to improve safety and driving performance. This system is part of Huawei's broader strategy to establish itself as a key player in the automotive sector, particularly in autonomous driving technology. The substantial cost of luxury SUVs, driven by advanced technologies, premium materials, superior craftsmanship, and brand value, restricts their accessibility to a niche customer segment. This pricing strategy primarily targets affluent buyers, thereby limiting the overall customer base. In emerging economies, high import duties and taxes further escalate prices, making these vehicles even less attainable. Additionally, ongoing expenses such as maintenance, insurance premiums, and fuel costs significantly increase the total cost of ownership, disc\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Research Report', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-by-fuel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market, By Fuel, 2022 - 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-market-revenue-share-by-sales-channel-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Market Revenue Share, By Sales Channel, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/china-luxury-suv-market-size-2025-2034..webp', 'alt_text': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'China Luxury SUV Market Size, 2022- 2034 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/luxury-suv-company-market-share-2025-2034.webp', 'alt_text': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'title': 'Luxury SUV Company Market Share, 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/mid-size-suv-market-21598', 'content': 'Mid-Size SUV Market Size, Share, Trends, Growth Report 2034  Industry Expertise Healthcare Life Science Medical Device Pharmaceutical Healthcare It Healthcare Services Chemicals And Materials Mining Advanced Materials AgroChemicals Basic Chemicals Metals & Alloys Polymers & Plastics Renewable Chemicals Speciality Chemicals Information And Communication Technology Ai And Analytics Cloud IoT And M2M Communication It Security Networking And Telecommunications Service Software Technology Semiconductor & Electronics Sensor And Control Test And Measurement Silion, Wafer And Fabrication Security, Access Control And Robotics Chipset And Processors Consumer Electronic Devices Camera, Display And Lighting Energy And Power Renewable Energy Industrial Motors, Pumps And Control Devices Driling, Intervention And Completion Batteries Offshore Oil And Gas Power Generation, Transmission And Distribution Food, Beverage & Nutrition Automobile Automotive Components Off Road Vehicles, Lcv, Hcv Telematics And Infotainment Ice, Electric, Hybrid, Autonomous Vehicles Bikes And Motorcycle Railway Tires And Wheels Automotive Technology, Services BFSI Consumer And Retail Aerospace & Defense Industrial Automation & Equipment Packaging & Transport Construction Agriculture Cat-Intel MedIntellix Consulting Services Strategic Consulting Granular Research Customer Acquisition Our Publications Syndicate Reports Category Intelligence News Insights Infographics Press Releases Articles Case Studies Videos Blogs About Us About MRFR Our Team Careers Contact Us Media Citation Testimonials Login info@marketresearchfuture.com +1 (855) 661-4441(US) +44 1720 412 167(UK) Search Certified Global Research Member Key Questions Answered Global Market Outlook In-depth analysis of global and regional trends Analyze and identify the major players in the market, their market share, key developments, etc. To understand the capability of the major players based on products offered, financials, and strategies.

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/ev-market-analysis/', 'content': 'Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Report Store Visit Corporate Site Sign In Menu Report Store Sign in Home Reports View all Reports Reports by Sector Aerospace and Defense Agriculture and Forestry Apparel Automotive Business and Consumer Services Chemicals Construction Consumer COVID-19 Financial Services Foodservice Government and Non-Profit Organisations Industrial Goods and Machinery Medical Devices Mining Oil and Gas Packaging Pharmaceuticals Power Retail Sport Technology Telecommunications Transportation, Infrastructure and Logistics Travel and Tourism Report Type Company Profile Track & Monitor Sector Analysis Product Insights Analyst Opinions Company Insights Thematic Analysis Case Studies Visit Corporate Site Search our Database Trending: Ukraine Crisis Briefing Inflation COVID-19 Sustainability Tesla Netflix Vaccine Home Reports Current: Automotive Current: Future Mobility Current: CASE Current: Electrification Current: Electrified Vehicles 2628041 1 Standard Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Trends and Analysis by Region, Body Type, Category, Source, Key Players and Forecast to 2035 Powered by All the vital news, analysis, and commentary curated by our industry experts. $3995 Buy Report Download FREE Resources Published: December 30, 2024 Report Code: GDAE1229MAR-ST Share Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Threads Share via Email Copy Link Select Item Report Overview Key Players Table of Contents Table Figures Electric Vehicles Market Report, Update 2024 Global Market Outlook, Trends, and Key Country Analysis is the latest market analysis report from GlobalData, the industry analysis specialist.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.qyresearch.com/reports/2147614/suv', 'content': 'Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 - QYResearch Industry Research Reports Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Home > Reports > Automobile & Transportation > Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 Industry: Automobile & Transportation Published: 2024-01-05 Pages: 96 Pages Report ld: 2147614 Request Sample Pre-Order Enquiry Description Table of Contents Table of Figures Related Reports PDF Download Description Table of Contents Table of Figures Related Reports PDF Download Description SUV is an automotive classification, typically a kind of station wagon/estate car with off-road vehicle features like raised ground clearance and ruggedness, and available four-wheel drive.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/suv-market', 'content': \"SUV Market Size, Share, Trends Analysis , Growth | Report, 2032 Press Releases Blog About Who We Are Why Select Us Careers Contact Services Consulting Other Services Research +1 929-297-9727 +44-748-134-3712 Search Result Reports Press Blogs Healthcare Animal Health Biotechnology Clinical Diagnostics Healthcare IT Medical Devices Pharmaceuticals Chemicals & Material Adhesives & Sealants Advanced Materials Agrochemicals & Fertilizers Paints & Coatings Personal Care & Cosmetics Petrochemicals Plastics, Polymers & Resins Specialty & Fine Chemicals Water Treatment Chemicals Energy Power & Utilities Equipment & Utilities Oil & Gas Power Generation, Transmission & Distribution Renewable Energy Information & Communication Technology Communication Infrastructure & Services Data Center & Networking Digital Media IT Security & Services Software & Solutions Telecom & Wireless Electronics & Semiconductors Display Technologies Electronic Devices Semiconductors Sensors & Controls Automotive & Transportation Automotive Parts & Components Automotive Services Vehicles Food & Beverages Animal Feed & Feed Additives Food Additive & Ingredient Nutraceutical & Functional Foods Processed & Frozen Food Construction & Mining Building & Construction Materials Construction & Mining Equipment Minerals & Metals Aerospace & Defense Aviation Defense Space Technologies Unmanned Systems Consumer Goods & Services Apparel & Footwear Beauty & Personal Care Consumer Electrical & Electronics Consumer F&B Homecare & Decor Nextgen Technology IT Industries New Technology SUV Market Size, Share, Trends Analysis , Growth | Report, 2024-2032 Inquire Before Buying Request Free Sample SUV Market Size, Share, Trends Analysis , Growth | Report, 2024-2032 What's Included in Full Report?

The report also helps stakeholders understand the pulse of the market and provides them with information on key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities. The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies. Further, the introduction of autonomous SUVs with enhanced safety features and higher level of automation is shifting the trends in the SUV market. Moreover, OEMs are focused on reducing the production cost of the vehicle by standadizing the platform technology and planning & developing unique platforms for all the SUVs under their brand. Furthermore, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) SUVs can be a major break-through in the SUVs market. Although the FCEV technology is still in the initial stages, planned research & development is carried out and can become a next major factor in the overall automotive industry, SUVs included. In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s. Autonomous SUVs are anticipated to witness growth Autonomous SUVs are projected to grow significantly during the forecast due to the rising demand for safety, comfort, and driving convenience features.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.qyresearch.com/reports/2147614/suv', 'content': 'Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 - QYResearch Industry Research Reports Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Home > Reports > Automobile & Transportation > Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 Global SUV Market Research Report 2024 Industry: Automobile & Transportation Published: 2024-01-05 Pages: 96 Pages Report ld: 2147614 Request Sample Pre-Order Enquiry Description Table of Contents Table of Figures Related Reports PDF Download Description Table of Contents Table of Figures Related Reports PDF Download Description SUV is an automotive classification, typically a kind of station wagon/estate car with off-road vehicle features like raised ground clearance and ruggedness, and available four-wheel drive.
