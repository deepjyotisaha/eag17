Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tata-Harrier-EV-Stealth-edition-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier EV Stealth edition', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-520802 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tata-Harrier-EV-Stealth-edition-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier EV Stealth edition', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-520802 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/top-5-upcoming-mahindra-vehicle-launches/2991432/', 'content': 'Top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicle launches - Car News | The Financial Express FE AUTO NEWS CAR NEWS BIKE NEWS New Cars New Cars Best Cars REVIEWS PHOTOS VIDEOS WEB STORIES EV FE AUTO NEWS CAR NEWS BIKE NEWS New Cars New Cars Best Cars REVIEWS PHOTOS VIDEOS WEB STORIES EV Auto Car News Top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicle launches Top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicle launches Upcoming Mahindra launches in 2023 and 2024. Here are the top five Mahindra SUV and electric vehicle launches expected in India. Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

The XUV300 Facelift focuses on design updates and potential ADAS features, enhancing safety and aesthetics. The XUV.e8 represents Mahindra's electric SUV ambition, offering a substantial range and all-wheel-drive capability. The XUV400 Facelift aims to improve range and design based on the XUV300.",

            "summary": "Based on recent Mahindra launches, the Thar 5-Door, XUV300 Facelift, XUV.e8, and XUV400 Facelift are potential options. The best choice depends on individual priorities, such as off-road capability, safety, electric range, and budget. More information is needed to make a specific recommendation.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report analyzes recent and upcoming Mahindra car launches in 2024 to provide a recommendation for a user seeking to purchase a new car. The analysis considers factors such as fuel efficiency, safety features, technology, and overall value. However, given the broad nature of the request, the recommendation is contingent on further information regarding the user's specific needs, budget, and preferences.\n\n**Overview of Mahindra Launches in 2024**\n\nBased on available information, Mahindra is expected to launch or facelift several models in 2024:\n\n*   **Mahindra Thar 5-Door:** A more practical version of the popular off-road vehicle with a larger footprint, additional features, and both petrol and diesel engine options.\n*   **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift:** A refreshed version of the sub-4m SUV with exterior design changes, a redesigned cabin, and potential ADAS features.\n*   **Mahindra XUV.e8:** An all-electric version of the XUV700, offered with two battery pack options and a dual-motor all-wheel drivetrain.\n*   **Mahindra XUV400 Facelift:** An updated EV showcasing design updates reminiscent of the facelifted XUV300, with an improved range.\n\n**Comparative Analysis**\n\nTo facilitate a better understanding of the options, the following table provides a comparative overview of the key features and specifications of each model:\n\n| Feature                  | Mahindra Thar 5-Door              | Mahindra XUV300 Facelift           | Mahindra XUV.e8                    | Mahindra XUV400 Facelift            |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Engine Options           | Petrol and Diesel                   | Petrol and Diesel                   | Electric                             | Electric                             |\n| Expected Price (Rs Lakh) | 15                                  | 9                                 | 35                                 | 16                                 |\n| Expected Launch          | March 2024                          | March 2024                          | End of 2024                        | Second half of 2024               |\n| Key Features             | Larger size, bigger infotainment, sunroof, 4WD/RWD configurations | Redesigned cabin, potential ADAS      | Dual-motor AWD, long range           | Improved range, design updates       |\n| Target Audience          | Off-road enthusiasts, families        | Compact SUV buyers, safety conscious | EV enthusiasts, long-range drivers | EV buyers, city drivers             |\n\n**Recommendation Justification**\n\nThe most suitable recommendation depends heavily on the user's specific requirements. Here's a breakdown of potential recommendations based on different priorities:\n\n*   **For off-road enthusiasts and those seeking adventure:** The Mahindra Thar 5-Door is an excellent choice. It offers the ruggedness and off-road capability of the Thar with added practicality and space. The availability of both petrol and diesel engines provides flexibility in terms of fuel preference.\n\n*   **For buyers seeking a safe and stylish compact SUV:** The Mahindra XUV300 Facelift is a compelling option. The refreshed design and potential ADAS features enhance both aesthetics and safety. The compact size makes it suitable for city driving.\n\n*   **For those prioritizing electric mobility and long-range driving:** The Mahindra XUV.e8 is a promising contender. With its extended range and all-wheel-drive capability, it offers a premium electric SUV experience.\n\n*   **For buyers looking for an updated and affordable EV:** The Mahindra XUV400 Facelift is a viable option. The design updates and improved range make it a more attractive EV choice.\n\n**Factors Not Considered**\n\nThe above recommendations are based on the limited information available. To provide a more tailored recommendation, it's crucial to consider the following factors:\n\n*   **Budget:** The user's budget will significantly narrow down the options. The XUV.e8, with its higher expected price, may not be suitable for all buyers.\n\n*   **Intended Use:** The intended use of the car (city driving vs. highway, family car vs. individual use) will influence the choice. For example, a family with young children might prioritize safety and space, while an individual might prioritize fuel efficiency and maneuverability.\n\n*   **Fuel Preference:** The user's preference for petrol, diesel, or electric vehicles will further refine the selection.\n\n**Further Questions for the User**\n\nTo provide a more specific and accurate recommendation, the following questions should be asked:\n\n1.  What is your budget for the new car?\n2.  What will be the primary use of the car (city driving, highway, off-roading, family trips)?\n3.  Do you have a preference for petrol, diesel, or electric vehicles?\n4.  What are your top priorities in a car (safety, fuel efficiency, performance, technology, comfort)?\n5.  How many passengers will the car typically need to accommodate?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMahindra's upcoming launches in 2024 offer a diverse range of options to suit different needs and preferences. By considering the factors mentioned above and gathering more information from the user, a more tailored and effective recommendation can be provided. Further research into real world reviews and comparisons once the vehicles are launched will also aid in the decision making process.",

Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark.

Here are the top five Mahindra SUV and electric vehicle launches expected in India. Written by Rajkamal Narayanan February 24, 2023 11:55 IST Follow Us Mahindra has been on a spree of launching new vehicles such as the XUV700 , the new Scorpio -N, the all-electric XUV400, and the rear-wheel-drive Thar. The carmakers not done just yet, as there are more launches to expect from Mahindra. The company has plans to launch SUVs, cars, and electric vehicles in India. Here are the top 5 upcoming Mahindra vehicles, including new SUVs, electric vehicles, and cars. Mahindra Thar 5-door The Mahindra Thar has seen a fair bit of success in India since its launch as its a huge leap over the older-gen vehicle. To make the Thar lineup more practical, the carmaker has plans to launch a long-wheelbase version of the SUV, which will have five doors. The Mahindra Thar 5-door version has been spied numerous times while testing and is expected to launch this year. The 5-door Thar could carry over the same 2.2-litre diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. Similar to the current-gen Thar, the 5-door version could be offered in 4X2 and 4X4 trims. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Image credit: Rushlane Next on the cards is again a long-wheelbase version of an SUV currently on sale the Mahindra Bolero Neo. To be called the Bolero Neo Plus, the SUV is based on the Mahindra TUV300 Plus that was discontinued in India. The Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus has been spotted testing in India, and when launched later this year, it will be offered with different seating configurations and could be powered by a 2.2-litre diesel engine making 120bhp. Mahindra e20 NXT Mahindras first-ever electric car, the e20 is due for an update as the EV market is picking up pace. The e20 was showcased earlier with new updates, however, there has been no word from Mahindra about its launch, and looking at Tatas Tiago EV racking up numbers, Mahindra could think of a similar strategy. Also Read Tata Tiago EV launched in India at Rs 8.49 lakh Mahindra eKUV100 The KUV100 is a strong contender to be electrified, as this makes a practical vehicle for city use. Mahindra could rename the vehicle altogether, however, it will borrow most of its design elements from the KUV100. If Mahindra manages to price it right, the eKUV100 could be a strong competitor to the Tata Tiago EV. Also Read Four upcoming Maruti Suzuki cars and SUVs in 2023 Mahindra XUV500 This may get fans excited, as Mahindra confirmed that the XUV500 will be making a comeback, either late this year or early next year. The Mahindra XUV500 will see significant design updates compared to its older-gen model, while it will sit between the XUV300 and the XUV700 in Mahindras lineup. The new Mahindra XUV500 is expected to carry forward the same engine from the XUV700, but in a detuned state to make less power. Also, when launched, the XUV500 is expected to feature ADAS tech along with a host of other interior upgrades.

The analysis considers factors such as fuel efficiency, safety features, technology, and overall value. However, given the broad nature of the request, the recommendation is contingent on further information regarding the user's specific needs, budget, and preferences.\n\n**Overview of Mahindra Launches in 2024**\n\nBased on available information, Mahindra is expected to launch or facelift several models in 2024:\n\n*   **Mahindra Thar 5-Door:** A more practical version of the popular off-road vehicle with a larger footprint, additional features, and both petrol and diesel engine options.\n*   **Mahindra XUV300 Facelift:** A refreshed version of the sub-4m SUV with exterior design changes, a redesigned cabin, and potential ADAS features.\n*   **Mahindra XUV.e8:** An all-electric version of the XUV700, offered with two battery pack options and a dual-motor all-wheel drivetrain.\n*   **Mahindra XUV400 Facelift:** An updated EV showcasing design updates reminiscent of the facelifted XUV300, with an improved range.\n\n**Comparative Analysis**\n\nTo facilitate a better understanding of the options, the following table provides a comparative overview of the key features and specifications of each model:\n\n| Feature                  | Mahindra Thar 5-Door              | Mahindra XUV300 Facelift           | Mahindra XUV.e8                    | Mahindra XUV400 Facelift            |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Engine Options           | Petrol and Diesel                   | Petrol and Diesel                   | Electric                             | Electric                             |\n| Expected Price (Rs Lakh) | 15                                  | 9                                 | 35                                 | 16                                 |\n| Expected Launch          | March 2024                          | March 2024                          | End of 2024                        | Second half of 2024               |\n| Key Features             | Larger size, bigger infotainment, sunroof, 4WD/RWD configurations | Redesigned cabin, potential ADAS      | Dual-motor AWD, long range           | Improved range, design updates       |\n| Target Audience          | Off-road enthusiasts, families        | Compact SUV buyers, safety conscious | EV enthusiasts, long-range drivers | EV buyers, city drivers             |\n\n**Recommendation Justification**\n\nThe most suitable recommendation depends heavily on the user's specific requirements. Here's a breakdown of potential recommendations based on different priorities:\n\n*   **For off-road enthusiasts and those seeking adventure:** The Mahindra Thar 5-Door is an excellent choice. It offers the ruggedness and off-road capability of the Thar with added practicality and space. The availability of both petrol and diesel engines provides flexibility in terms of fuel preference.\n\n*   **For buyers seeking a safe and stylish compact SUV:** The Mahindra XUV300 Facelift is a compelling option. The refreshed design and potential ADAS features enhance both aesthetics and safety. The compact size makes it suitable for city driving.\n\n*   **For those prioritizing electric mobility and long-range driving:** The Mahindra XUV.e8 is a promising contender. With its extended range and all-wheel-drive capability, it offers a premium electric SUV experience.\n\n*   **For buyers looking for an updated and affordable EV:** The Mahindra XUV400 Facelift is a viable option. The design updates and improved range make it a more attractive EV choice.\n\n**Factors Not Considered**\n\nThe above recommendations are based on the limited information available. To provide a more tailored recommendation, it's crucial to consider the following factors:\n\n*   **Budget:** The user's budget will significantly narrow down the options. The XUV.e8, with its higher expected price, may not be suitable for all buyers.\n\n*   **Intended Use:** The intended use of the car (city driving vs. highway, family car vs. individual use) will influence the choice. For example, a family with young children might prioritize safety and space, while an individual might prioritize fuel efficiency and maneuverability.\n\n*   **Fuel Preference:** The user's preference for petrol, diesel, or electric vehicles will further refine the selection.\n\n**Further Questions for the User**\n\nTo provide a more specific and accurate recommendation, the following questions should be asked:\n\n1.  What is your budget for the new car?\n2.  What will be the primary use of the car (city driving, highway, off-roading, family trips)?\n3.  Do you have a preference for petrol, diesel, or electric vehicles?\n4.  What are your top priorities in a car (safety, fuel efficiency, performance, technology, comfort)?\n5.  How many passengers will the car typically need to accommodate?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMahindra's upcoming launches in 2024 offer a diverse range of options to suit different needs and preferences. By considering the factors mentioned above and gathering more information from the user, a more tailored and effective recommendation can be provided. Further research into real world reviews and comparisons once the vehicles are launched will also aid in the decision making process.",
