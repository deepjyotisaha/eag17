Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,985 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: Your Complete Guide Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,985 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant w\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: Your Complete Guide Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.
