Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cardekho.com/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specs', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications - Dimensions, Configurations, Features, Engine cc Ad Select City All New Used English Login New Cars Explore New Cars Electric Cars Mahindra BE 6 Mahindra XEV 9e Tata Harrier EV MG Windsor EV Tata Nexon EV MG Comet EV All Electric Cars Popular Cars Hyundai Creta Defender Mahindra XUV 3XO Mahindra Thar ROXX Mahindra Scorpio Maruti Swift All Popular Cars Upcoming Cars New Launches Car Insurance Ad Popular Brands Maruti Cars Tata Cars Kia Cars Toyota Cars Hyundai Cars Mahindra Cars Compare Cars New Car Offers & Discounts Find Car Dealers Find EV Charging Stations Find Fuel Stations Check Fuel Prices Used Cars Buy Used Cars Used Cars In Your City Ahmedabad Bangalore Chennai Delhi NCR Hyderabad Jaipur Kolkata Mumbai Pune More Cities Sell My Car Used Car Valuation Dealership Near Me News & Reviews News & Top stories Car Expert Reviews User Reviews Car Collection Tips & Advice Videos Video Reviews Visual Stories Ask AI.CarDekho XUV 3XO Price Compare Images Specs User Reviews 360 View Variants Videos More Mileage Colours XUV 3XO News FAQs Dealers Service Center Brochure XUV 3XO EMI Loan Second Hand XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications The Mahindra XUV 3XO has 1 Diesel Engine and 1 Petrol Engine on offer.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,990 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cardekho.com/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specs', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications - Dimensions, Configurations, Features, Engine cc Ad Select City All New Used English Login New Cars Explore New Cars Electric Cars Mahindra BE 6 Mahindra XEV 9e Tata Harrier EV MG Windsor EV Tata Nexon EV MG Comet EV All Electric Cars Popular Cars Hyundai Creta Defender Mahindra XUV 3XO Mahindra Thar ROXX Mahindra Scorpio Maruti Swift All Popular Cars Upcoming Cars New Launches Car Insurance Ad Popular Brands Maruti Cars Tata Cars Kia Cars Toyota Cars Hyundai Cars Mahindra Cars Compare Cars New Car Offers & Discounts Find Car Dealers Find EV Charging Stations Find Fuel Stations Check Fuel Prices Used Cars Buy Used Cars Used Cars In Your City Ahmedabad Bangalore Chennai Delhi NCR Hyderabad Jaipur Kolkata Mumbai Pune More Cities Sell My Car Used Car Valuation Dealership Near Me News & Reviews News & Top stories Car Expert Reviews User Reviews Car Collection Tips & Advice Videos Video Reviews Visual Stories Ask AI.CarDekho XUV 3XO Price Compare Images Specs User Reviews 360 View Variants Videos More Mileage Colours XUV 3XO News FAQs Dealers Service Center Brochure XUV 3XO EMI Loan Second Hand XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications The Mahindra XUV 3XO has 1 Diesel Engine and 1 Petrol Engine on offer.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,990 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.
