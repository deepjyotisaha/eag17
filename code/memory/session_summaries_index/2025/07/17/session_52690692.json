Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.
