The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,941 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://cargraze.com/blog/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-specs-design-performance-and-safety', 'content': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO: Specs, Design, Performance, and Safety  | Cargraze Home Cars Car Blog Tools Loan EMI Calculator Mileage Calculator Sell Used Car Check RC Login/ Register Home Car Info 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO: Specs, Design, Performance, and Safety 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO: Specs, Design, Performance, and Safety Published On Dec 24, 2024 By Cargraze for Car Info A Comprehensive Review of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in 2025: Features, Performance, and Value Are you looking for a compact yet powerful vehicle that combines performance, safety, and value in one stunning package? The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,941 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 86,941 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 26.03-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | MX2 Pro 1.2 Petrol MT | MX3 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment. At the back, you sur\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20240502111525_First Drive 3XO Web.001.jpeg?w=700&c=1', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO review', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO review', 'class': 'img-fluid', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20240502012130_First Drive 3XO Web.008.jpeg?w=700&c=1', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO front quarter', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO front quarter', 'class': 'img-fluid', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20240502012130_First Drive 3XO Web.014.jpeg?w=700&c=1', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV', 'class': 'img-fluid', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20240502012130_First Drive 3XO Web.016.jpeg?w=700&c=1', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO review - Feature and power packed compact SUV', 'class': 'img-fluid', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/model/uploads/modelimages/Mahindra-XUV-3XO-290420241902.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Latest Image of Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'class': 'img-fluid wid-img', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/official-new-car-reviews/279937-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review.html', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - Team-BHP Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photo Gallery About Us Contact Us Store Classifieds Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Advertise Team-BHP > Team-BHP Reviews > Official New Car Reviews 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review Register New Topics New Posts More Search Forums Show Threads Show Posts Search Titles Only Advanced Search Go to Page...

Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble Some important features missing (ventilated seats, parcel tray, full-sized spare wheel, paddle shifters etc.) This review has been jointly compiled with Axe77 . Thanks to him for the expert observations! Since the Mahindra XUV 300 has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2024 facelift. To read the full official review, click here . The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) Link to Review Introduction It's hard to believe how big the small SUV / crossover segment has become. Almost all the manufacturers have introduced products in this lucrative segment. Mahindra is no exception. Their smallest SUV, the XUV300 was launched in India back in 2019. While it didn't make a very big impact in the market, over the years, it has seen some good sales numbers. The car has essentially remained the same since the launch, but now in 2024, Mahindra has finally decided to introduce a facelift. Since it is a major update after a long time, Mahindra has decided to rename the car as well - the XUV300 is now the XUV 3XO. So, what's new on the XUV 3XO? It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. There's a lot to cover, so let's get right into it. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price & Brochure Back in 2019, the XUV300 was launched with a diesel and a turbo-petrol engine with manual transmissions. Now, the XUV 3XO is being offered with 3 engine options with manual and automatic options. You get a 1.5-litre, 115 BHP, diesel engine mated to a 6-speed MT with the option of an AMT. Then you have a 110 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) mated to 6-speed MT or the new 6-speed AT. Finally, you have the 129 BHP, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with Gasoline Direct injection (GDi) mated to a 6-speed MT or the 6-speed AT. Prices start at Rs. 7.49 lakh for the base MX1 variant with the 1.2L turbo-petrol (MPFI) 6MT and go up to Rs. 15.49 lakh for\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601348d1714564249t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_01.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601349d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_02.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601350d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_03.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601351d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_04.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/official-new-car-reviews/2601352d1714564293t-2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'alt_text': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review-2024_mahindra_xuv3xo_exterior_05.jpg', 'width': '800', 'height': '533', 'class': 'thumbnail', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://cargraze.com/blog/2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-specs-design-performance-and-safety', 'content': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO: Specs, Design, Performance, and Safety  | Cargraze Home Cars Car Blog Tools Loan EMI Calculator Mileage Calculator Sell Used Car Check RC Login/ Register Home Car Info 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO: Specs, Design, Performance, and Safety 2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO: Specs, Design, Performance, and Safety Published On Dec 24, 2024 By Cargraze for Car Info A Comprehensive Review of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in 2025: Features, Performance, and Value Are you looking for a compact yet powerful vehicle that combines performance, safety, and value in one stunning package? The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!
