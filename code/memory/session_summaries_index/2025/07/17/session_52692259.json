It is considered as one of biggest car corporations in India and the largest tractor manufacturer in the entire world. The company is a division of a bigger company, the Mahindra group. Mahindra actually ranked the 21st spot in the Fortune India 500 Top Companies in 2011. They come in competition with other big car companies in India including Tata Motors , Ashok Leyland, Maruti Suzuki , and a lot more. M&M started to be a steel trading company in 1945 built by three brothers, K.C. Mahindra, J.C. Mahindra, and Malik Ghulan Mohammed. Its initial name then was Mahindra & Mohammed. Right after Indias Independence Day and Pakistan emerged to become a separate country, Mohammed fled to Pakistan. This led to the name change and became Mahindra & Mahindra in 1948. Related Other Indian Automobile Technology Force Motors: Bring in the Power When the demand came for MUVs, M&M started to transform the business into a car company. The company then later moved on to making light commercial vehicles and agricultural tractors. As of today, M&M is considered as the key player in manufacturing utility vehicles with their first model, the Mahindra XUV500 . The growth of the company did not stop there. Since the brothers wanted to venture on foreign markets and emerging industries, they bought Kinect Motors and started creating two-wheelers. They also have shared in the REVA Electric Car Company and later on bought the SsangYong Motor Company in 2011 from Korea.

The global presence of M&M is also topnotch.

Ltd., and the Mahindra South Africa.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the data from the previous step (T001), several Mahindra vehicles are slated for launch or have been launched recently, primarily in July 2025. To determine the absolute latest launch, I will focus on confirmed launch dates rather than expected or tentative dates.\n\nThe search results indicate several potential launches, including the Mahindra BE 6, XUV700 Facelift, and Thar Electric. However, the Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series stands out due to its confirmed launch date of July 8, 2025, as stated on Mahindra's official website. Other mentions of July launches often refer to 'deliveries beginning' or 'expected' updates, which are not definitive launch dates. The Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series is available at an attractive price point (starting at ₹8.94 Lakh) and boasts premium features like leatherette seats, a sunroof, and a 26.03 cm infotainment system. It's powered by a 1.2L mStallion TCMPFi engine, offering a blend of style, performance, and value. According to the Mahindra newsroom press release, the REVX series has distinctive exterior styling and is aimed towards customers who seek vehicles that reflect their unique personality, celebrating the spirit of personal expression.\n\nWhile other vehicles such as the BE 6 and XEV 9e also had news around deliveries in late July 2025, they are not explicitly labeled as a launch with a specific date in the provided data. The Indian Autos Blog shows launches for the Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series starting at 8.94 Lakh on July 9, 2025. Mahindra launched the XUV 3XO REVX series starting at 8.94 Lakh on 7/8/2025. The fact that the Mahindra website states a confirmed launch date, and provides details on the vehicle, is the key factor for this recommendation.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, the Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series is the recommended vehicle due to its confirmed launch date of July 8, 2025, as well as its appealing features and value proposition.",

It is considered as one of biggest car corporations in India and the largest tractor manufacturer in the entire world. The company is a division of a bigger company, the Mahindra group. Mahindra actually ranked the 21st spot in the Fortune India 500 Top Companies in 2011. They come in competition with other big car companies in India including Tata Motors , Ashok Leyland, Maruti Suzuki , and a lot more. M&M started to be a steel trading company in 1945 built by three brothers, K.C. Mahindra, J.C. Mahindra, and Malik Ghulan Mohammed. Its initial name then was Mahindra & Mohammed. Right after Indias Independence Day and Pakistan emerged to become a separate country, Mohammed fled to Pakistan. This led to the name change and became Mahindra & Mahindra in 1948. Related Other Indian Automobile Technology Force Motors: Bring in the Power When the demand came for MUVs, M&M started to transform the business into a car company. The company then later moved on to making light commercial vehicles and agricultural tractors. As of today, M&M is considered as the key player in manufacturing utility vehicles with their first model, the Mahindra XUV500 . The growth of the company did not stop there. Since the brothers wanted to venture on foreign markets and emerging industries, they bought Kinect Motors and started creating two-wheelers. They also have shared in the REVA Electric Car Company and later on bought the SsangYong Motor Company in 2011 from Korea.

The global presence of M&M is also topnotch.

It is considered as one of biggest car corporations in India and the largest tractor manufacturer in the entire world. The company is a division of a bigger company, the Mahindra group. Mahindra actually ranked the 21st spot in the Fortune India 500 Top Companies in 2011. They come in competition with other big car companies in India including Tata Motors , Ashok Leyland, Maruti Suzuki , and a lot more. M&M started to be a steel trading company in 1945 built by three brothers, K.C. Mahindra, J.C. Mahindra, and Malik Ghulan Mohammed. Its initial name then was Mahindra & Mohammed. Right after Indias Independence Day and Pakistan emerged to become a separate country, Mohammed fled to Pakistan. This led to the name change and became Mahindra & Mahindra in 1948.

The company then later moved on to making light commercial vehicles and agricultural tractors. As of today, M&M is considered as the key player in manufacturing utility vehicles with their first model, the Mahindra XUV500 . The growth of the company did not stop there. Since the brothers wanted to venture on foreign markets and emerging industries, they bought Kinect Motors and started creating two-wheelers. They also have shared in the REVA Electric Car Company and later on bought the SsangYong Motor Company in 2011 from Korea.

To determine the absolute latest launch, I will focus on confirmed launch dates rather than expected or tentative dates.\n\nThe search results indicate several potential launches, including the Mahindra BE 6, XUV700 Facelift, and Thar Electric. However, the Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series stands out due to its confirmed launch date of July 8, 2025, as stated on Mahindra's official website. Other mentions of July launches often refer to 'deliveries beginning' or 'expected' updates, which are not definitive launch dates. The Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series is available at an attractive price point (starting at ₹8.94 Lakh) and boasts premium features like leatherette seats, a sunroof, and a 26.03 cm infotainment system. It's powered by a 1.2L mStallion TCMPFi engine, offering a blend of style, performance, and value. According to the Mahindra newsroom press release, the REVX series has distinctive exterior styling and is aimed towards customers who seek vehicles that reflect their unique personality, celebrating the spirit of personal expression.\n\nWhile other vehicles such as the BE 6 and XEV 9e also had news around deliveries in late July 2025, they are not explicitly labeled as a launch with a specific date in the provided data. The Indian Autos Blog shows launches for the Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series starting at 8.94 Lakh on July 9, 2025. Mahindra launched the XUV 3XO REVX series starting at 8.94 Lakh on 7/8/2025. The fact that the Mahindra website states a confirmed launch date, and provides details on the vehicle, is the key factor for this recommendation.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, the Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX series is the recommended vehicle due to its confirmed launch date of July 8, 2025, as well as its appealing features and value proposition.",
