The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The automaker is set to keep this momentum in 2025 by unveiling new models in its XEV and BE electric lineup while upgrading its popular ICE-powered vehicles. Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2. XEV 7e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 21 lakh The production-ready XEV 7e, a fully electric version of the XUV700, is expected to rival premium EVs with features like a triple-screen layout, multi-zone climate control, and ADAS. Equipped with 59 kWh and 79 kWh battery options, it could offer a range of up to 650 km. 3. Thar 3-door Facelift Expected Launch: April 2025 Expected Price: 12 lakh Following the successful launch of the 5-door Thar Roxx, Mahindra is set to refresh the 3-door variant. This facelift is expected to feature updated styling with a 6-slat grille, C-shaped LED DRLs, and dual-tone alloys, along with an upgraded cabin. Engine options will likely include 1.5L diesel, 2.2L diesel, and 2.0L turbo-petrol options. 4. Mahindra BE 07 Expected Launch: August 15, 2025 Expected Price: 30 lakh Mahindra initially named the electric SUV BE 6E and later due to issues with Indigo airlines they had to rename it as BE 6E. While we know the official starting price of the Mahindra BE 6 electric SUV. We have no information about the higher variants and pricing. Mahindra will be revealing the variants and pricing of this electric SUV in January during the Bharat Mobility Expo. 5. Thar Roxx Petrol 44 Launch: To be Announced Mahindra as we know launched the Roxx in the market earlier this year and deliveries for the same have also started. Mahindra is only offering 44 as an option with some of the variants. The 44 is currently available with diesel engine option only. However, there is a possibility that Mahindra might introduce a smaller 1.5 liter diesel engine and a petrol 44 variant might get introduced later next year. With a mix of cutting-edge EVs and exciting updates to existing models, Mahindra aims to dominate the automotive scene in 2025. Whether youre looking for innovative electric SUVs or refreshed classics, theres something for everyone. Share Tweet Add a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
