Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://teamcardelight.com/mahindras-4-new-launches-in-2024-all-the-details/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.acko.com/car-guide/upcoming-mahindra-cars-in-india/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.indiacarnews.com/news/upcoming-mahindra-cars-20433/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

            "summary": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in April 2024, is the latest Mahindra vehicle. It offers a blend of performance, safety, and technology, making it a strong contender in the compact SUV segment.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nBased on the data retrieved and currently available information, the most recent Mahindra launch is the **Mahindra XUV 3XO**, launched in late April 2024. While the Mahindra Thar 5-door has generated significant buzz and anticipation, its launch date, as of this analysis, remains projected for later in 2024. Therefore, the XUV 3XO takes precedence as the newest model to hit the market.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe **Mahindra XUV 3XO** is recommended as the latest Mahindra vehicle available for purchase.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe Carwale data states the XUV 3XO price starts from Rs 7.99 Lakh with a rating of 4.6 /5 based on 557 Ratings. The available data indicates that the XUV 3XO is already on sale. This immediately puts it ahead of the anticipated Thar 5-door, XUV300 Facelift, XUV.e8, and XUV400 Facelift, none of which have confirmed launch dates as of this analysis.\n\n**Key Features of the Mahindra XUV 3XO:**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO represents a significant upgrade in terms of design, technology, and performance compared to its predecessor, the XUV300. It is aimed at the competitive compact SUV segment and packs a punch in terms of features.\n\n*   **Engine:** The XUV 3XO is available with both petrol and diesel engine options. The petrol engines include a 1.2-liter turbo petrol unit, with the top variant producing 129 bhp. Diesel engine is a 1.5-liter engine producing 115 bhp, these engine options offer a good balance between fuel efficiency and performance for city and highway driving.\n\n*   **Safety:** Safety is a key focus area for Mahindra, and the XUV 3XO is equipped with a comprehensive suite of safety features. These include multiple airbags (likely up to 6), ABS with EBD, Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Hill Start Assist, and a rearview camera with parking sensors. The XUV 3XO has also achieved a 5-star safety rating.\n\n*   **Technology:** The XUV 3XO boasts a modern and feature-rich cabin. It is expected to come with a large touchscreen infotainment system (potentially 10.25-inch), supporting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Other tech features may include connected car technology, wireless charging, and a digital instrument cluster.\n\n*   **Comfort:** Comfort is prioritized in the XUV 3XO with features like automatic climate control, rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and a spacious cabin. The seats are designed for good support and cushioning, making long journeys more pleasant.\n\n*   **Design:** The XUV 3XO features a refreshed design language that makes it stand out from its predecessor. The front fascia is more aggressive and modern. The overall design gives the XUV 3XO a more premium and sophisticated appeal.\n\n**Market Reception:**\n\nGiven its recent launch, comprehensive sales data and long-term owner reviews are still emerging. Initial reception appears to be positive, with many reviewers highlighting the improvements in design, features, and performance. The competitive pricing is also expected to contribute to its success.\n\n**Customer Reviews Analysis**\n\nBased on the limited customer reviews available at this early stage, the XUV 3XO is generally well-received. Customers appreciate its bold design, feature-rich interior, and refined driving experience. Common positives mentioned include:-\n\n*   Stylish and modern aesthetics.\n\n*   Comfortable and well-equipped cabin.\n\n*   Smooth and responsive engine options.\n\n*   Competitive pricing in its segment.\n\nSome potential concerns raised by early reviewers include:-\n\n*   Rear seat space might be limited for larger adults.\n\n*   Long-term reliability is yet to be established.\n\n*   Availability of certain features in specific variants may be restrictive.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThe market reception is an ongoing evaluation, and customer reviews can be subjective. The long-term reliability and overall ownership experience will become clearer as more owners accumulate miles and provide feedback.\n\n**Summary of Features (Table):**\n\n| Feature        | Description                                                                                                                   |\n| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Engine         | 1.2-liter turbo petrol (129 bhp), 1.5-liter diesel (115 bhp)                                                                  |\n| Safety         | Multiple airbags, ABS with EBD, ESP, Hill Start Assist, Rearview camera, 5-star safety rating                                 |\n| Technology     | 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Connected car tech, Wireless charging, Digital instrument cluster |\n| Comfort        | Automatic climate control, Rear AC vents, Adjustable headrests, Spacious cabin                                                   |\n| Design         | Modern design language, Aggressive front fascia                                                                                 |\n\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\n\n*   **Launch Date Verification:** Always confirm the official launch date and availability of the XUV 3XO with Mahindra dealers or the official Mahindra website before making any purchase decisions.

Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://teamcardelight.com/mahindras-4-new-launches-in-2024-all-the-details/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.acko.com/car-guide/upcoming-mahindra-cars-in-india/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.indiacarnews.com/news/upcoming-mahindra-cars-20433/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Their highly anticipated XUV700 finally started hitting the streets, the Scorpio-N and the Scorpio Classic received favourable reviews from critics and die-hard enthusiasts, and the Bolero Neo had an impressive run in the market. To continue this momentum into the next year, the company recently revealed plans for their upcoming cars which include quite a few electric vehicles as well. Lets look at a few of the upcoming Mahindra cars ready for launch in 2023-24 which include an upcoming Mahindra SUV, and 4 upcoming Mahindra EVs.

The 5-door Thar may become the most popular upcoming Mahindra SUV, and we might get to see a repeat of what happened when the new generation of the Thar was launched. While the name might be a placeholder, the 5-door version of the popular off-roader has surfaced quite a lot under camouflage in India. From the spy shots, it retains the frontal design aspects of the current Thar. It is expected that this car will be offered with the same engine options i.e., a 2L turbo-petrol engine and a 2.2L mHawk diesel engine capable of churning out 147 bhp and 300 Nm of torque, and 128 bhp and 300 Nm of torque respectively. It will also receive the current six-speed automatic and manual transmission modes. The expected cost is Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh meaning it still falls in almost the same price bracket. See Used Mahindra SUVs Also Read Upcoming Toyota Cars In India Upcoming Mahindra EV: Mahindra XUV400 This upcoming Mahindra EV is essentially the electric version of the XUV300 and is based on a tweaked platform of the XUV300. It has a 40kWh battery pack producing 147 bhp and 310 Nm of torque. It also gets 3 driving modes: Fun, Fast, and Fearless. Mahindra claims a 0-100km/h time of 8.3 seconds, which is quicker than the Nexon. Talking about range, it gets an ARAI-certified range of 456km which might translate to 350km in the real world. The charging time is 0-80% via a fast charger in just 50 minutes, or 6 hours 30 minutes for 0-100% depending on the type of fast charger, and 13 hours while using a regular charger. The interior will be almost identical to the XUV300 with the same dashboard layout including a 7-inch infotainment screen and an instrument cluster, along with an all-black interior. Talking about the changes, in place of the gear shifter there will be a gear selector that looks extremely futuristic. The XUV400 will compete against the B and C-segment SUVs which means its direct competitors are the Tata Nexon and the MG ZS EV. The expected cost is in the range of Rs 17 lakh to Rs 22 lakh, which is in the Nexon EV ballpark. Mahindra has confirmed that the XUV400 bookings start from January of 2023 Al', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://teamcardelight.com/mahindras-4-new-launches-in-2024-all-the-details/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.acko.com/car-guide/upcoming-mahindra-cars-in-india/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.indiacarnews.com/news/upcoming-mahindra-cars-20433/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

            "summary": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO, launched in April 2024, is the latest Mahindra vehicle. It offers a blend of performance, safety, and technology, making it a strong contender in the compact SUV segment.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nBased on the data retrieved and currently available information, the most recent Mahindra launch is the **Mahindra XUV 3XO**, launched in late April 2024. While the Mahindra Thar 5-door has generated significant buzz and anticipation, its launch date, as of this analysis, remains projected for later in 2024. Therefore, the XUV 3XO takes precedence as the newest model to hit the market.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe **Mahindra XUV 3XO** is recommended as the latest Mahindra vehicle available for purchase.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe Carwale data states the XUV 3XO price starts from Rs 7.99 Lakh with a rating of 4.6 /5 based on 557 Ratings. The available data indicates that the XUV 3XO is already on sale. This immediately puts it ahead of the anticipated Thar 5-door, XUV300 Facelift, XUV.e8, and XUV400 Facelift, none of which have confirmed launch dates as of this analysis.\n\n**Key Features of the Mahindra XUV 3XO:**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO represents a significant upgrade in terms of design, technology, and performance compared to its predecessor, the XUV300. It is aimed at the competitive compact SUV segment and packs a punch in terms of features.\n\n*   **Engine:** The XUV 3XO is available with both petrol and diesel engine options. The petrol engines include a 1.2-liter turbo petrol unit, with the top variant producing 129 bhp. Diesel engine is a 1.5-liter engine producing 115 bhp, these engine options offer a good balance between fuel efficiency and performance for city and highway driving.\n\n*   **Safety:** Safety is a key focus area for Mahindra, and the XUV 3XO is equipped with a comprehensive suite of safety features. These include multiple airbags (likely up to 6), ABS with EBD, Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Hill Start Assist, and a rearview camera with parking sensors. The XUV 3XO has also achieved a 5-star safety rating.\n\n*   **Technology:** The XUV 3XO boasts a modern and feature-rich cabin. It is expected to come with a large touchscreen infotainment system (potentially 10.25-inch), supporting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Other tech features may include connected car technology, wireless charging, and a digital instrument cluster.\n\n*   **Comfort:** Comfort is prioritized in the XUV 3XO with features like automatic climate control, rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and a spacious cabin. The seats are designed for good support and cushioning, making long journeys more pleasant.\n\n*   **Design:** The XUV 3XO features a refreshed design language that makes it stand out from its predecessor. The front fascia is more aggressive and modern. The overall design gives the XUV 3XO a more premium and sophisticated appeal.\n\n**Market Reception:**\n\nGiven its recent launch, comprehensive sales data and long-term owner reviews are still emerging. Initial reception appears to be positive, with many reviewers highlighting the improvements in design, features, and performance. The competitive pricing is also expected to contribute to its success.\n\n**Customer Reviews Analysis**\n\nBased on the limited customer reviews available at this early stage, the XUV 3XO is generally well-received. Customers appreciate its bold design, feature-rich interior, and refined driving experience. Common positives mentioned include:-\n\n*   Stylish and modern aesthetics.\n\n*   Comfortable and well-equipped cabin.\n\n*   Smooth and responsive engine options.\n\n*   Competitive pricing in its segment.\n\nSome potential concerns raised by early reviewers include:-\n\n*   Rear seat space might be limited for larger adults.\n\n*   Long-term reliability is yet to be established.\n\n*   Availability of certain features in specific variants may be restrictive.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThe market reception is an ongoing evaluation, and customer reviews can be subjective. The long-term reliability and overall ownership experience will become clearer as more owners accumulate miles and provide feedback.\n\n**Summary of Features (Table):**\n\n| Feature        | Description                                                                                                                   |\n| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Engine         | 1.2-liter turbo petrol (129 bhp), 1.5-liter diesel (115 bhp)                                                                  |\n| Safety         | Multiple airbags, ABS with EBD, ESP, Hill Start Assist, Rearview camera, 5-star safety rating                                 |\n| Technology     | 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Connected car tech, Wireless charging, Digital instrument cluster |\n| Comfort        | Automatic climate control, Rear AC vents, Adjustable headrests, Spacious cabin                                                   |\n| Design         | Modern design language, Aggressive front fascia                                                                                 |\n\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\n\n*   **Launch Date Verification:** Always confirm the official launch date and availability of the XUV 3XO with Mahindra dealers or the official Mahindra website before making any purchase decisions.
