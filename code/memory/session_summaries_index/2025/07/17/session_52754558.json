Your task is to find and extract comprehensive details about the features of the Mahindra XUV 3XO. \n\nFirst, identify a set of relevant URLs that provide detailed information about the vehicle's features, specifications, and reviews. Use search queries targeting official Mahindra sources, reputable automotive review sites, and user forums.\n\nIteratively refine your search. Start with broad queries like 'Mahindra XUV 3XO features' and 'Mahindra XUV 3XO specifications'. Then, use more specific queries to target specific features and aspects such as 'Mahindra XUV 3XO safety features', 'Mahindra XUV 3XO technology', 'Mahindra XUV 3XO interior features', and 'Mahindra XUV 3XO mileage'. For each feature, try to find at least 3 distinct and reliable sources.\n\nFrom the identified URLs, extract detailed information about each feature. Include specifications, performance metrics, available options, and customer reviews. Organize the extracted data into a structured format with clear headings and subheadings for each feature. For each feature, please extract the following information: description, specifications, variants available, images/videos, reviews. If the exact information is not found, mention that information is not available. \n\nOutput a JSON object where the keys are major feature categories (e.g., 'Engine', 'Safety', 'Technology', 'Interior', 'Exterior') and the values are lists of feature details. Each feature detail should include the source URL, feature description, specs, variants, and available images/videos.",
