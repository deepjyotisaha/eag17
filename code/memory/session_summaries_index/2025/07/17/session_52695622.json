Heres a comprehensive look at Mahindras exciting launches and updates slated for 2025. 1. XUV 4XO EV / XEV 4e Expected Launch: March 2025 Expected Price: 16 lakh The all-electric version of the XUV 3XO, potentially named XUV 4XO EV or XEV 4e, was recently spotted testing. Likely to feature 34.5 kWh and 39.5 kWh battery options similar to the XUV400 EV, this model will offer a futuristic design and advanced features. Expect it to launch with a slightly higher price than its predecessor, priced between 16.74 lakh and 17.69 lakh (ex-showroom). 2.
