In this part we will dive into most common operations and methods with strings. This is not the whole list of possible string manipulations. String Variable Declaration You can declare a string variable by assigning a string value to a variable name using the equals sign = . Here\\'s an example: my_string = \"Hello, world!\" In this example, we have declared a string variable called my_string and assigned it the value \"Hello, world!\" . Note that the string value is enclosed in quotation marks. You can also declare an empty string variable by assigning an empty string value to a variable name, like this: my_string = \"\" In this case, we have declared a string variable called my_string and assigned it an empty string value. String Concatenation String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. In Python, you can concatenate strings using the + operator. One more option to append a string is using += operator. Let\\'s look at an example of appending a string: str1 = \"Hello\" str2 = \"World\" result = str1 + \" \" + str2 print(result) # Output: Hello World In the example above, we have created two string variables str1 and str2 containing the strings \"Hello\" and \"World\" respectively. We then use the + operator to add one string to another, along with a space character, to create a single string result. Finally, we print the result of adding to the console, which outputs \"Hello World\". A Variable in a String In Python, you can include variables within strings using different methods. Here are a few commonly used ways to achieve this: String Concatenation : you can concatenate strings and variables using the + operator: name = \"Alice\" age = 30 message = \"Hello, my name is \" + name + \" and I am \" + str(age) + \" years old.\" print(message) Using the str.format() Method : this method allows you to embed variables in a string using placeholders {} : name = \"Bob\" age = 25 message = \"Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.\".format(name, age) print(message) Using f-strings (formatted string literals) : introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise way to embed variables directly within strings by prefixing the string with f and using {} to enclose variables: name = \"Charlie\" age = 35 message = f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\" print(message) All of these methods achieve the same result, but f-strings are often preferred due to their readability and ease of use. They allow you to directly reference variables within the string, making the code cleaner and more understandable. String Length You can get the length of a string using the built-in function len() . You can also check if a string is empty using this method. Here is an example of calculating the characters that a string contains: my_string = \"Hello, world!\" print(len(my_string)) # Output: 13 In this example, the len() function returns the number of characters in the my_string variable, which is 13. You can also use len() to get the length of a string variable that is empty or contains whitespace: empty_string = \"\" print(len(empty_string)) # Output: 0 whitespace_string = \"  \" print(len(whitespace_string)) # Output: 3 In both cases, the len() function returns the length of the string, which is 0 for the empty string and 3 for the string co', 'images': [{'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/textimage_store/cache/styles/tutorial_1024/a/a3/a345e55de3e9f1793c0c2fb017ff21d47b5904c1d9258dc3634a656947f25a65.webp', 'alt_text': 'Text and String Variables in Python', 'width': '1024', 'height': '576', 'class': 'mt-0 bg-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/almargit.jpeg?itok=zCzmThTN', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user almargit', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-24 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/AliaksandrSumich.jpeg?itok=jVEXj0ZS', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user AliaksandrSumich', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-16 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/angarsky.jpeg?itok=XviFRcNo', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user angarsky', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-16 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_assign_string_variable.asp', 'content': 'Python Assign String Variables Tutorials Exercises Certificates Services Menu Search field  Sign In +1 Get Certified For Teachers Spaces Plus Get Certified For Teachers Spaces Plus My W3Schools Tutorials Exercises Certificates Services Spaces Get Certified Plus Academy Logout   Tutorials Tutorials filter input HTML and CSS Learn HTML Tutorial Reference Learn CSS Tutorial Reference Learn RWD Tutorial Learn Bootstrap Overview Learn W3.CSS Tutorial Reference Learn Sass Tutorial Reference Learn Colors Tutorial Reference Learn Icons Tutorial Reference Learn SVG Tutorial Reference Learn Canvas Tutorial Reference Learn Graphics Tutorial Learn Character Sets Reference Learn How To Tutorial Data Analytics Learn AI Tutorial Learn Generative AI Tutorial Learn ChatGPT-3.5 Tutorial Learn ChatGPT-4 Tutorial Learn Google Bard Tutorial Learn Machine Learning Tutorial Learn DSA Tutorial Learn Data Science Tutorial Learn NumPy Tutorial Learn Pandas Tutorial Learn SciPy Tutorial Learn Matplotlib Tutorial Learn Statistics Tutorial Learn Excel Tutorial Learn Google Sheets Tutorial Web Building Create a Website HOT!

Shape Your Future Menu Menu Blog Courses Learn 9 Simple Ways to Print Hello World in Python December 8, 2024 February 20, 2022 by Claudio Sabato Printing Hello World is usually the first thing a developer does when starting with a new programming language. In this article, we will see how to print Hello World in Python. The simplest way to print Hello World in Python is to pass a string to the print() function. The next step is to assign the string Hello World to a variable and then pass the variable to the print() function. This message can also be printed by using the + operator to concatenate two variables where the value of the first variable is Hello and the value of the second variable is World. And these are just some ways to do that Lets get creative and explore other possible ways! 1. How Do You Print Hello World in Python? To print a message in Python you use the print() function. This is a function that receives a string as input and prints its value on the screen. Let me explain Create a file called hello_world.py and add the following line of code to the file: print(\"Hello World\") Note : you can create this file in a text editor or even better in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. To run your program you can use the following command: python hello_world.py [output] Hello World We have specified the python command followed by the name of our Python program. The extension .py identifies a file that contains Python code. Important : in this tutorial, we are using Python 3.8. Also, in the following examples, we will always update the file hello_world.py with new code and we will execute our program using the Python command above. 2. Printing Hello World Using a Variable In the previous section, we printed Hello World directly using the print() function. This time I want to show you that its possible to assign the string Hello World to a variable first. Then after doing that you can print the value of the variable using the print() function. Note : a variable allows storing data to be used in your program (in this case the string Hello World). message = \"Hello World using a variable\" print(message) [output] Hello World using a variable Using the assignment operator ( = ) we have assigned the value on the right side of the operator to the variable message on its left side. 3. Concatenate two Python Strings to Print Hello World We can also print our message by doing the following: Store the word Hello in a variable called word1 Store the word World in a variable called word2 Concatenate the two variables using the + operator word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(word1 + \" \" + word2) Confirm that the output is Hello World. Notice that we have concatenated one space character  after word1 and before word2 to have a space between the words Hello and World. Lets see what happens if we remove that space character: print(word1 + word2) [output] HelloWorld We have removed the space between the two words. 4. Use the String format() Method to Print Hello World Using the + operator to concatenate strings can get confusing when you try to create very long strings that contain several variables. A cleaner option is to use the string format() method . word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(\"{} {}\".format(word1, word2)) The first and second sets of curly brackets {} are replaced respectively by the values of the variables word1 and word2. Lets confirm the output is correct: Hello World It is correct! 5. Using Python f-strings to Print Hello World With Python 3.6 and later you can use an alternative approach to the string format() method: Python f-strings . Here is how it works word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(f\"{word1} {word2} using f-strings\") [output] Hello World using f-strings Notice the f letter just before the double quote. This format is easier to read compared to the previous one considering that the variables word1 and word2', 'images': [{'url': 'https://codefather.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/codefather_picture_transparent-e1680370631264.png', 'alt_text': 'Claudio Sabato - Codefather - Software Engineer and Programming Coach', 'width': '100', 'height': '100', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://codefather.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/learn-coding-with-videos-ideas-v2.png', 'alt_text': 'Learn Python coding with step-by-step video tutorials', 'class': 'wp-image-16003', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://dataxom.com/assign-string-to-a-variable-with-python/', 'content': 'Assign String to a Variable with Python My Blog Aller au contenu Home About Services Contact Request Quote Request Quote Main Menu Home About Services Contact Assign String to a Variable with Python Laisser un commentaire / Python courses Assign String to a Variable Assigning strings to variables is a fundamental operation in Python programming. This guide provides an in-depth look at how to assign strings to variables, along with examples and best practices. Declaring a String In Python, you can assign a string to a variable using the assignment operator (=). Strings should be enclosed in single quotes (), double quotes (), or triple quotes ( or ), depending on your needs. Using Single Quotes # Assigning a string to a variable using single quotes\\r my_string = \\'Hello, world!\\'\\r print(my_string) # Output: Hello, world! Using Double Quotes # Assigning a string to a variable using double quotes\\r my_string = \"Hello, world!\"\\r print(my_string) # Output: Hello, world! Using Triple Quotes Triple quotes are useful for multi-line strings or when including both single and double quotes without escaping. # Assigning a multi-line string to a variable using triple quotes\\r my_string = \"\"\"This is a string\\r that spans multiple lines.\"\"\"\\r print(my_string) Naming Conventions Valid Variable Names Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), followed by letters, digits, or underscores. They should not contain spaces or special characters. # Valid variable names\\r string1 = \"Hello\"\\r string_variable = \"Hello, World!\"\\r _string123 = \"Example\" Invalid Variable Names Variable names cannot start with a digit and should not be Python reserved keywords. # Invalid variable names\\r 1st_string = \"Invalid\" # Error: starts with a digit\\r string-variable = \"Invalid\" # Error: contains a hyphen\\r class = \"Invalid\" # Error: reserved keyword String Concatenation You can concatenate multiple strings by using the + operator. # Concatenating strings\\r string1 = \"Hello\"\\r string2 = \"world!\"\\r complete_string = string1 + \" \" + string2\\r print(complete_string) # Output: Hello world! String Multiplication Strings can be repeated a specified number of times using the * operator. # Multiplying strings\\r string = \"Hello! \"\\r repeated_string = string * 3\\r print(repeated_string) # Output: Hello! Hello! Hello! Using Variables to Create Dynamic Strings Variables can be used to create dynamic strings by inserting them into other strings using concatenation or formatted strings. Concatenation with Variables name = \"Alice\"\\r greeting = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\\r print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice! f-strings (Python 3.6+) f-strings provide a concise way to embed expressions inside strings. format() Method The format() method allows you to insert variables into a string with format specifiers. name = \"Alice\"\\r greeting = \"Hello, {}!\".format(name)\\r print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice! Manipulating Strings Assigned to Variables Accessing Characters You can access individual characters in a string using indexing. my_string = \"Python\"\\r print(my_string[0]) # Output: P\\r print(my_string[1]) # Output: y Slicing Strings Slicing allows you to extract substrings from a string. my_string = \"Python Programming\"\\r substring = my_string[0:6]\\r print(substring) # Output: Python Multiple Assignments You can assign the same string to multiple variables in a single line. string1 = string2 = \"Same content!\"\\r print(string1) # Output: Same content!\\r print(string2) # Output: Same content! Practical Examples Creating a Welcome Message Use variables to create a personalized welcome message Creating a Dynamic URL Combine parts of a URL with variables. base_url = \"https://www.example.com/\"\\r page = \"contact\"\\r complete_url = base_url + page\\r print(complete_url) # Output: https://www.example.com/contact Generating a Simple Report Use variables to generate a simple report. client_name = \"Alice\"\\r amount = 123.45\\r report = f\"Invoice for {client_name}: {amount} USD\"\\r print(report) # Output: Invoice for Alice:', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/insert-a-variable-into-a-string-python/', 'content': 'Insert a Variable into a String - Python - GeeksforGeeks Skip to content Courses DSA to Development GATE 2026 Prep Get 3 IBM Certifications For Working Professionals Interview 101: DSA & System Design Data Science Training Program JAVA Backend Development (Live) Data Analytics Training DevOps Engineering (LIVE) Data Structures & Algorithms in Python For Students Placement Preparation with DSA Data Science (Live) Data Structure & Algorithm-Self Paced (C++/JAVA) Master Competitive Programming Full Stack Development with React & Node JS (Live) (NEW) Digital Marketing Program Full Stack Development Data Science & ML Program All Courses Tutorials Python Java Data Structures & Algorithms ML & Data Science Interview Corner Programming Languages Web Development GATE CS Subjects DevOps And Linux School Learning Software and Tools Practice Practice Coding Problems Nation Skillup- Free Courses Problem of the Day ETS TOEFL: Scholarship Contest Jobs Become a Mentor Apply Now!

For example , if we have a variable containing the word \"Hello\" and another containing \"World\", we want to combine them into a single string like \"Hello World\". Let\\'s explore the different methods to insert variables into strings effectively. Using f-strings f-strings (formatted string literals) were introduced in Python 3.6 and have quickly become the most recommended way to insert variables into strings. They are concise, readable and faster than other traditional methods. Python a = \"Python\" res = f \"This is { a } programming!\" print ( res ) Output This is Python programming! Explanation: In an f-string, the variable a is inserted directly by placing it inside {} within a string prefixed with f , enabling dynamic content without manual concatenation. Using format() Before f-strings , the .format() method was the standard way to insert variables into strings. It remains widely used, especially in projects requiring compatibility with Python versions earlier than 3.6. Python a = \"Hello\" b = \"world\" res = \" {} {} \" . format ( a , b ) print ( res ) Output Hello world Explanation: In the format() method, placeholders {} are used inside the string, and variables a and b are inserted by passing them to format(), allowing dynamic content without manual concatenation. Using + operator + operator is a basic method to combine strings and variables, but it can get messy with multiple variables or different data types. Python a = \"Hello\" b = \"World\" res = a + \" \" + b print ( res ) Output Hello World Explanation: Using the + operator, the variables a and b are joined with a space between them, manually concatenating strings to create dynamic content. Using % formatting This method was used in earlier versions of Python and is still supported, but it\\'s less preferred today due to better alternatives like format() and f-strings . Python a = \"Python\" res = \"This is %s programming!\" % a print ( res ) Output This is Python programming! Explanation: In % formatting, the %s placeholder inside the string is replaced by the value of a , allowing variable insertion in a style similar to old C-style formatting.

In this part we will dive into most common operations and methods with strings. This is not the whole list of possible string manipulations. String Variable Declaration You can declare a string variable by assigning a string value to a variable name using the equals sign = . Here\\'s an example: my_string = \"Hello, world!\" In this example, we have declared a string variable called my_string and assigned it the value \"Hello, world!\" . Note that the string value is enclosed in quotation marks. You can also declare an empty string variable by assigning an empty string value to a variable name, like this: my_string = \"\" In this case, we have declared a string variable called my_string and assigned it an empty string value. String Concatenation String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. In Python, you can concatenate strings using the + operator. One more option to append a string is using += operator. Let\\'s look at an example of appending a string: str1 = \"Hello\" str2 = \"World\" result = str1 + \" \" + str2 print(result) # Output: Hello World In the example above, we have created two string variables str1 and str2 containing the strings \"Hello\" and \"World\" respectively. We then use the + operator to add one string to another, along with a space character, to create a single string result. Finally, we print the result of adding to the console, which outputs \"Hello World\". A Variable in a String In Python, you can include variables within strings using different methods. Here are a few commonly used ways to achieve this: String Concatenation : you can concatenate strings and variables using the + operator: name = \"Alice\" age = 30 message = \"Hello, my name is \" + name + \" and I am \" + str(age) + \" years old.\" print(message) Using the str.format() Method : this method allows you to embed variables in a string using placeholders {} : name = \"Bob\" age = 25 message = \"Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.\".format(name, age) print(message) Using f-strings (formatted string literals) : introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise way to embed variables directly within strings by prefixing the string with f and using {} to enclose variables: name = \"Charlie\" age = 35 message = f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\" print(message) All of these methods achieve the same result, but f-strings are often preferred due to their readability and ease of use. They allow you to directly reference variables within the string, making the code cleaner and more understandable. String Length You can get the length of a string using the built-in function len() . You can also check if a string is empty using this method. Here is an example of calculating the characters that a string contains: my_string = \"Hello, world!\" print(len(my_string)) # Output: 13 In this example, the len() function returns the number of characters in the my_string variable, which is 13. You can also use len() to get the length of a string variable that is empty or contains whitespace: empty_string = \"\" print(len(empty_string)) # Output: 0 whitespace_string = \"  \" print(len(whitespace_string)) # Output: 3 In both cases, the len() function returns the length of the string, which is 0 for the empty string and 3 for the string co', 'images': [{'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/textimage_store/cache/styles/tutorial_1024/a/a3/a345e55de3e9f1793c0c2fb017ff21d47b5904c1d9258dc3634a656947f25a65.webp', 'alt_text': 'Text and String Variables in Python', 'width': '1024', 'height': '576', 'class': 'mt-0 bg-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/almargit.jpeg?itok=zCzmThTN', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user almargit', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-24 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/AliaksandrSumich.jpeg?itok=jVEXj0ZS', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user AliaksandrSumich', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-16 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/angarsky.jpeg?itok=XviFRcNo', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user angarsky', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-16 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_assign_string_variable.asp', 'content': 'Python Assign String Variables Tutorials Exercises Certificates Services Menu Search field  Sign In +1 Get Certified For Teachers Spaces Plus Get Certified For Teachers Spaces Plus My W3Schools Tutorials Exercises Certificates Services Spaces Get Certified Plus Academy Logout   Tutorials Tutorials filter input HTML and CSS Learn HTML Tutorial Reference Learn CSS Tutorial Reference Learn RWD Tutorial Learn Bootstrap Overview Learn W3.CSS Tutorial Reference Learn Sass Tutorial Reference Learn Colors Tutorial Reference Learn Icons Tutorial Reference Learn SVG Tutorial Reference Learn Canvas Tutorial Reference Learn Graphics Tutorial Learn Character Sets Reference Learn How To Tutorial Data Analytics Learn AI Tutorial Learn Generative AI Tutorial Learn ChatGPT-3.5 Tutorial Learn ChatGPT-4 Tutorial Learn Google Bard Tutorial Learn Machine Learning Tutorial Learn DSA Tutorial Learn Data Science Tutorial Learn NumPy Tutorial Learn Pandas Tutorial Learn SciPy Tutorial Learn Matplotlib Tutorial Learn Statistics Tutorial Learn Excel Tutorial Learn Google Sheets Tutorial Web Building Create a Website HOT!

Shape Your Future Menu Menu Blog Courses Learn 9 Simple Ways to Print Hello World in Python December 8, 2024 February 20, 2022 by Claudio Sabato Printing Hello World is usually the first thing a developer does when starting with a new programming language. In this article, we will see how to print Hello World in Python. The simplest way to print Hello World in Python is to pass a string to the print() function. The next step is to assign the string Hello World to a variable and then pass the variable to the print() function. This message can also be printed by using the + operator to concatenate two variables where the value of the first variable is Hello and the value of the second variable is World. And these are just some ways to do that Lets get creative and explore other possible ways! 1. How Do You Print Hello World in Python? To print a message in Python you use the print() function. This is a function that receives a string as input and prints its value on the screen. Let me explain Create a file called hello_world.py and add the following line of code to the file: print(\"Hello World\") Note : you can create this file in a text editor or even better in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. To run your program you can use the following command: python hello_world.py [output] Hello World We have specified the python command followed by the name of our Python program. The extension .py identifies a file that contains Python code. Important : in this tutorial, we are using Python 3.8. Also, in the following examples, we will always update the file hello_world.py with new code and we will execute our program using the Python command above. 2. Printing Hello World Using a Variable In the previous section, we printed Hello World directly using the print() function. This time I want to show you that its possible to assign the string Hello World to a variable first. Then after doing that you can print the value of the variable using the print() function. Note : a variable allows storing data to be used in your program (in this case the string Hello World). message = \"Hello World using a variable\" print(message) [output] Hello World using a variable Using the assignment operator ( = ) we have assigned the value on the right side of the operator to the variable message on its left side. 3. Concatenate two Python Strings to Print Hello World We can also print our message by doing the following: Store the word Hello in a variable called word1 Store the word World in a variable called word2 Concatenate the two variables using the + operator word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(word1 + \" \" + word2) Confirm that the output is Hello World. Notice that we have concatenated one space character  after word1 and before word2 to have a space between the words Hello and World. Lets see what happens if we remove that space character: print(word1 + word2) [output] HelloWorld We have removed the space between the two words. 4. Use the String format() Method to Print Hello World Using the + operator to concatenate strings can get confusing when you try to create very long strings that contain several variables. A cleaner option is to use the string format() method . word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(\"{} {}\".format(word1, word2)) The first and second sets of curly brackets {} are replaced respectively by the values of the variables word1 and word2. Lets confirm the output is correct: Hello World It is correct! 5. Using Python f-strings to Print Hello World With Python 3.6 and later you can use an alternative approach to the string format() method: Python f-strings . Here is how it works word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(f\"{word1} {word2} using f-strings\") [output] Hello World using f-strings Notice the f letter just before the double quote. This format is easier to read compared to the previous one considering that the variables word1 and word2', 'images': [{'url': 'https://codefather.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/codefather_picture_transparent-e1680370631264.png', 'alt_text': 'Claudio Sabato - Codefather - Software Engineer and Programming Coach', 'width': '100', 'height': '100', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://codefather.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/learn-coding-with-videos-ideas-v2.png', 'alt_text': 'Learn Python coding with step-by-step video tutorials', 'class': 'wp-image-16003', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://dataxom.com/assign-string-to-a-variable-with-python/', 'content': 'Assign String to a Variable with Python My Blog Aller au contenu Home About Services Contact Request Quote Request Quote Main Menu Home About Services Contact Assign String to a Variable with Python Laisser un commentaire / Python courses Assign String to a Variable Assigning strings to variables is a fundamental operation in Python programming. This guide provides an in-depth look at how to assign strings to variables, along with examples and best practices. Declaring a String In Python, you can assign a string to a variable using the assignment operator (=). Strings should be enclosed in single quotes (), double quotes (), or triple quotes ( or ), depending on your needs. Using Single Quotes # Assigning a string to a variable using single quotes\\r my_string = \\'Hello, world!\\'\\r print(my_string) # Output: Hello, world! Using Double Quotes # Assigning a string to a variable using double quotes\\r my_string = \"Hello, world!\"\\r print(my_string) # Output: Hello, world! Using Triple Quotes Triple quotes are useful for multi-line strings or when including both single and double quotes without escaping. # Assigning a multi-line string to a variable using triple quotes\\r my_string = \"\"\"This is a string\\r that spans multiple lines.\"\"\"\\r print(my_string) Naming Conventions Valid Variable Names Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), followed by letters, digits, or underscores. They should not contain spaces or special characters. # Valid variable names\\r string1 = \"Hello\"\\r string_variable = \"Hello, World!\"\\r _string123 = \"Example\" Invalid Variable Names Variable names cannot start with a digit and should not be Python reserved keywords. # Invalid variable names\\r 1st_string = \"Invalid\" # Error: starts with a digit\\r string-variable = \"Invalid\" # Error: contains a hyphen\\r class = \"Invalid\" # Error: reserved keyword String Concatenation You can concatenate multiple strings by using the + operator. # Concatenating strings\\r string1 = \"Hello\"\\r string2 = \"world!\"\\r complete_string = string1 + \" \" + string2\\r print(complete_string) # Output: Hello world! String Multiplication Strings can be repeated a specified number of times using the * operator. # Multiplying strings\\r string = \"Hello! \"\\r repeated_string = string * 3\\r print(repeated_string) # Output: Hello! Hello! Hello! Using Variables to Create Dynamic Strings Variables can be used to create dynamic strings by inserting them into other strings using concatenation or formatted strings. Concatenation with Variables name = \"Alice\"\\r greeting = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\\r print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice! f-strings (Python 3.6+) f-strings provide a concise way to embed expressions inside strings. format() Method The format() method allows you to insert variables into a string with format specifiers. name = \"Alice\"\\r greeting = \"Hello, {}!\".format(name)\\r print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice! Manipulating Strings Assigned to Variables Accessing Characters You can access individual characters in a string using indexing. my_string = \"Python\"\\r print(my_string[0]) # Output: P\\r print(my_string[1]) # Output: y Slicing Strings Slicing allows you to extract substrings from a string. my_string = \"Python Programming\"\\r substring = my_string[0:6]\\r print(substring) # Output: Python Multiple Assignments You can assign the same string to multiple variables in a single line. string1 = string2 = \"Same content!\"\\r print(string1) # Output: Same content!\\r print(string2) # Output: Same content! Practical Examples Creating a Welcome Message Use variables to create a personalized welcome message Creating a Dynamic URL Combine parts of a URL with variables. base_url = \"https://www.example.com/\"\\r page = \"contact\"\\r complete_url = base_url + page\\r print(complete_url) # Output: https://www.example.com/contact Generating a Simple Report Use variables to generate a simple report. client_name = \"Alice\"\\r amount = 123.45\\r report = f\"Invoice for {client_name}: {amount} USD\"\\r print(report) # Output: Invoice for Alice:', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/insert-a-variable-into-a-string-python/', 'content': 'Insert a Variable into a String - Python - GeeksforGeeks Skip to content Courses DSA to Development GATE 2026 Prep Get 3 IBM Certifications For Working Professionals Interview 101: DSA & System Design Data Science Training Program JAVA Backend Development (Live) Data Analytics Training DevOps Engineering (LIVE) Data Structures & Algorithms in Python For Students Placement Preparation with DSA Data Science (Live) Data Structure & Algorithm-Self Paced (C++/JAVA) Master Competitive Programming Full Stack Development with React & Node JS (Live) (NEW) Digital Marketing Program Full Stack Development Data Science & ML Program All Courses Tutorials Python Java Data Structures & Algorithms ML & Data Science Interview Corner Programming Languages Web Development GATE CS Subjects DevOps And Linux School Learning Software and Tools Practice Practice Coding Problems Nation Skillup- Free Courses Problem of the Day ETS TOEFL: Scholarship Contest Jobs Become a Mentor Apply Now!

For example , if we have a variable containing the word \"Hello\" and another containing \"World\", we want to combine them into a single string like \"Hello World\". Let\\'s explore the different methods to insert variables into strings effectively. Using f-strings f-strings (formatted string literals) were introduced in Python 3.6 and have quickly become the most recommended way to insert variables into strings. They are concise, readable and faster than other traditional methods. Python a = \"Python\" res = f \"This is { a } programming!\" print ( res ) Output This is Python programming! Explanation: In an f-string, the variable a is inserted directly by placing it inside {} within a string prefixed with f , enabling dynamic content without manual concatenation. Using format() Before f-strings , the .format() method was the standard way to insert variables into strings. It remains widely used, especially in projects requiring compatibility with Python versions earlier than 3.6. Python a = \"Hello\" b = \"world\" res = \" {} {} \" . format ( a , b ) print ( res ) Output Hello world Explanation: In the format() method, placeholders {} are used inside the string, and variables a and b are inserted by passing them to format(), allowing dynamic content without manual concatenation. Using + operator + operator is a basic method to combine strings and variables, but it can get messy with multiple variables or different data types. Python a = \"Hello\" b = \"World\" res = a + \" \" + b print ( res ) Output Hello World Explanation: Using the + operator, the variables a and b are joined with a space between them, manually concatenating strings to create dynamic content. Using % formatting This method was used in earlier versions of Python and is still supported, but it\\'s less preferred today due to better alternatives like format() and f-strings . Python a = \"Python\" res = \"This is %s programming!\" % a print ( res ) Output This is Python programming! Explanation: In % formatting, the %s placeholder inside the string is replaced by the value of a , allowing variable insertion in a style similar to old C-style formatting.

In this part we will dive into most common operations and methods with strings. This is not the whole list of possible string manipulations. String Variable Declaration You can declare a string variable by assigning a string value to a variable name using the equals sign = . Here\\'s an example: my_string = \"Hello, world!\" In this example, we have declared a string variable called my_string and assigned it the value \"Hello, world!\" . Note that the string value is enclosed in quotation marks. You can also declare an empty string variable by assigning an empty string value to a variable name, like this: my_string = \"\" In this case, we have declared a string variable called my_string and assigned it an empty string value. String Concatenation String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. In Python, you can concatenate strings using the + operator. One more option to append a string is using += operator. Let\\'s look at an example of appending a string: str1 = \"Hello\" str2 = \"World\" result = str1 + \" \" + str2 print(result) # Output: Hello World In the example above, we have created two string variables str1 and str2 containing the strings \"Hello\" and \"World\" respectively. We then use the + operator to add one string to another, along with a space character, to create a single string result. Finally, we print the result of adding to the console, which outputs \"Hello World\". A Variable in a String In Python, you can include variables within strings using different methods. Here are a few commonly used ways to achieve this: String Concatenation : you can concatenate strings and variables using the + operator: name = \"Alice\" age = 30 message = \"Hello, my name is \" + name + \" and I am \" + str(age) + \" years old.\" print(message) Using the str.format() Method : this method allows you to embed variables in a string using placeholders {} : name = \"Bob\" age = 25 message = \"Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.\".format(name, age) print(message) Using f-strings (formatted string literals) : introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise way to embed variables directly within strings by prefixing the string with f and using {} to enclose variables: name = \"Charlie\" age = 35 message = f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\" print(message) All of these methods achieve the same result, but f-strings are often preferred due to their readability and ease of use. They allow you to directly reference variables within the string, making the code cleaner and more understandable. String Length You can get the length of a string using the built-in function len() . You can also check if a string is empty using this method. Here is an example of calculating the characters that a string contains: my_string = \"Hello, world!\" print(len(my_string)) # Output: 13 In this example, the len() function returns the number of characters in the my_string variable, which is 13. You can also use len() to get the length of a string variable that is empty or contains whitespace: empty_string = \"\" print(len(empty_string)) # Output: 0 whitespace_string = \"  \" print(len(whitespace_string)) # Output: 3 In both cases, the len() function returns the length of the string, which is 0 for the empty string and 3 for the string co', 'images': [{'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/textimage_store/cache/styles/tutorial_1024/a/a3/a345e55de3e9f1793c0c2fb017ff21d47b5904c1d9258dc3634a656947f25a65.webp', 'alt_text': 'Text and String Variables in Python', 'width': '1024', 'height': '576', 'class': 'mt-0 bg-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/almargit.jpeg?itok=zCzmThTN', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user almargit', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-24 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/AliaksandrSumich.jpeg?itok=jVEXj0ZS', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user AliaksandrSumich', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-16 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://diveintopython.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/user-pictures/angarsky.jpeg?itok=XviFRcNo', 'alt_text': 'Profile picture for user angarsky', 'width': '220', 'height': '220', 'class': 'rounded-full w-16 mt-0 mb-4', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_assign_string_variable.asp', 'content': 'Python Assign String Variables Tutorials Exercises Certificates Services Menu Search field  Sign In +1 Get Certified For Teachers Spaces Plus Get Certified For Teachers Spaces Plus My W3Schools Tutorials Exercises Certificates Services Spaces Get Certified Plus Academy Logout   Tutorials Tutorials filter input HTML and CSS Learn HTML Tutorial Reference Learn CSS Tutorial Reference Learn RWD Tutorial Learn Bootstrap Overview Learn W3.CSS Tutorial Reference Learn Sass Tutorial Reference Learn Colors Tutorial Reference Learn Icons Tutorial Reference Learn SVG Tutorial Reference Learn Canvas Tutorial Reference Learn Graphics Tutorial Learn Character Sets Reference Learn How To Tutorial Data Analytics Learn AI Tutorial Learn Generative AI Tutorial Learn ChatGPT-3.5 Tutorial Learn ChatGPT-4 Tutorial Learn Google Bard Tutorial Learn Machine Learning Tutorial Learn DSA Tutorial Learn Data Science Tutorial Learn NumPy Tutorial Learn Pandas Tutorial Learn SciPy Tutorial Learn Matplotlib Tutorial Learn Statistics Tutorial Learn Excel Tutorial Learn Google Sheets Tutorial Web Building Create a Website HOT!

Shape Your Future Menu Menu Blog Courses Learn 9 Simple Ways to Print Hello World in Python December 8, 2024 February 20, 2022 by Claudio Sabato Printing Hello World is usually the first thing a developer does when starting with a new programming language. In this article, we will see how to print Hello World in Python. The simplest way to print Hello World in Python is to pass a string to the print() function. The next step is to assign the string Hello World to a variable and then pass the variable to the print() function. This message can also be printed by using the + operator to concatenate two variables where the value of the first variable is Hello and the value of the second variable is World. And these are just some ways to do that Lets get creative and explore other possible ways! 1. How Do You Print Hello World in Python? To print a message in Python you use the print() function. This is a function that receives a string as input and prints its value on the screen. Let me explain Create a file called hello_world.py and add the following line of code to the file: print(\"Hello World\") Note : you can create this file in a text editor or even better in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. To run your program you can use the following command: python hello_world.py [output] Hello World We have specified the python command followed by the name of our Python program. The extension .py identifies a file that contains Python code. Important : in this tutorial, we are using Python 3.8. Also, in the following examples, we will always update the file hello_world.py with new code and we will execute our program using the Python command above. 2. Printing Hello World Using a Variable In the previous section, we printed Hello World directly using the print() function. This time I want to show you that its possible to assign the string Hello World to a variable first. Then after doing that you can print the value of the variable using the print() function. Note : a variable allows storing data to be used in your program (in this case the string Hello World). message = \"Hello World using a variable\" print(message) [output] Hello World using a variable Using the assignment operator ( = ) we have assigned the value on the right side of the operator to the variable message on its left side. 3. Concatenate two Python Strings to Print Hello World We can also print our message by doing the following: Store the word Hello in a variable called word1 Store the word World in a variable called word2 Concatenate the two variables using the + operator word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(word1 + \" \" + word2) Confirm that the output is Hello World. Notice that we have concatenated one space character  after word1 and before word2 to have a space between the words Hello and World. Lets see what happens if we remove that space character: print(word1 + word2) [output] HelloWorld We have removed the space between the two words. 4. Use the String format() Method to Print Hello World Using the + operator to concatenate strings can get confusing when you try to create very long strings that contain several variables. A cleaner option is to use the string format() method . word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(\"{} {}\".format(word1, word2)) The first and second sets of curly brackets {} are replaced respectively by the values of the variables word1 and word2. Lets confirm the output is correct: Hello World It is correct! 5. Using Python f-strings to Print Hello World With Python 3.6 and later you can use an alternative approach to the string format() method: Python f-strings . Here is how it works word1 = \"Hello\" word2 = \"World\" print(f\"{word1} {word2} using f-strings\") [output] Hello World using f-strings Notice the f letter just before the double quote. This format is easier to read compared to the previous one considering that the variables word1 and word2', 'images': [{'url': 'https://codefather.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/codefather_picture_transparent-e1680370631264.png', 'alt_text': 'Claudio Sabato - Codefather - Software Engineer and Programming Coach', 'width': '100', 'height': '100', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://codefather.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/learn-coding-with-videos-ideas-v2.png', 'alt_text': 'Learn Python coding with step-by-step video tutorials', 'class': 'wp-image-16003', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://dataxom.com/assign-string-to-a-variable-with-python/', 'content': 'Assign String to a Variable with Python My Blog Aller au contenu Home About Services Contact Request Quote Request Quote Main Menu Home About Services Contact Assign String to a Variable with Python Laisser un commentaire / Python courses Assign String to a Variable Assigning strings to variables is a fundamental operation in Python programming. This guide provides an in-depth look at how to assign strings to variables, along with examples and best practices. Declaring a String In Python, you can assign a string to a variable using the assignment operator (=). Strings should be enclosed in single quotes (), double quotes (), or triple quotes ( or ), depending on your needs. Using Single Quotes # Assigning a string to a variable using single quotes\\r my_string = \\'Hello, world!\\'\\r print(my_string) # Output: Hello, world! Using Double Quotes # Assigning a string to a variable using double quotes\\r my_string = \"Hello, world!\"\\r print(my_string) # Output: Hello, world! Using Triple Quotes Triple quotes are useful for multi-line strings or when including both single and double quotes without escaping. # Assigning a multi-line string to a variable using triple quotes\\r my_string = \"\"\"This is a string\\r that spans multiple lines.\"\"\"\\r print(my_string) Naming Conventions Valid Variable Names Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), followed by letters, digits, or underscores. They should not contain spaces or special characters. # Valid variable names\\r string1 = \"Hello\"\\r string_variable = \"Hello, World!\"\\r _string123 = \"Example\" Invalid Variable Names Variable names cannot start with a digit and should not be Python reserved keywords. # Invalid variable names\\r 1st_string = \"Invalid\" # Error: starts with a digit\\r string-variable = \"Invalid\" # Error: contains a hyphen\\r class = \"Invalid\" # Error: reserved keyword String Concatenation You can concatenate multiple strings by using the + operator. # Concatenating strings\\r string1 = \"Hello\"\\r string2 = \"world!\"\\r complete_string = string1 + \" \" + string2\\r print(complete_string) # Output: Hello world! String Multiplication Strings can be repeated a specified number of times using the * operator. # Multiplying strings\\r string = \"Hello! \"\\r repeated_string = string * 3\\r print(repeated_string) # Output: Hello! Hello! Hello! Using Variables to Create Dynamic Strings Variables can be used to create dynamic strings by inserting them into other strings using concatenation or formatted strings. Concatenation with Variables name = \"Alice\"\\r greeting = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\\r print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice! f-strings (Python 3.6+) f-strings provide a concise way to embed expressions inside strings. format() Method The format() method allows you to insert variables into a string with format specifiers. name = \"Alice\"\\r greeting = \"Hello, {}!\".format(name)\\r print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice! Manipulating Strings Assigned to Variables Accessing Characters You can access individual characters in a string using indexing. my_string = \"Python\"\\r print(my_string[0]) # Output: P\\r print(my_string[1]) # Output: y Slicing Strings Slicing allows you to extract substrings from a string. my_string = \"Python Programming\"\\r substring = my_string[0:6]\\r print(substring) # Output: Python Multiple Assignments You can assign the same string to multiple variables in a single line. string1 = string2 = \"Same content!\"\\r print(string1) # Output: Same content!\\r print(string2) # Output: Same content! Practical Examples Creating a Welcome Message Use variables to create a personalized welcome message Creating a Dynamic URL Combine parts of a URL with variables. base_url = \"https://www.example.com/\"\\r page = \"contact\"\\r complete_url = base_url + page\\r print(complete_url) # Output: https://www.example.com/contact Generating a Simple Report Use variables to generate a simple report. client_name = \"Alice\"\\r amount = 123.45\\r report = f\"Invoice for {client_name}: {amount} USD\"\\r print(report) # Output: Invoice for Alice:', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/insert-a-variable-into-a-string-python/', 'content': 'Insert a Variable into a String - Python - GeeksforGeeks Skip to content Courses DSA to Development GATE 2026 Prep Get 3 IBM Certifications For Working Professionals Interview 101: DSA & System Design Data Science Training Program JAVA Backend Development (Live) Data Analytics Training DevOps Engineering (LIVE) Data Structures & Algorithms in Python For Students Placement Preparation with DSA Data Science (Live) Data Structure & Algorithm-Self Paced (C++/JAVA) Master Competitive Programming Full Stack Development with React & Node JS (Live) (NEW) Digital Marketing Program Full Stack Development Data Science & ML Program All Courses Tutorials Python Java Data Structures & Algorithms ML & Data Science Interview Corner Programming Languages Web Development GATE CS Subjects DevOps And Linux School Learning Software and Tools Practice Practice Coding Problems Nation Skillup- Free Courses Problem of the Day ETS TOEFL: Scholarship Contest Jobs Become a Mentor Apply Now!

For example , if we have a variable containing the word \"Hello\" and another containing \"World\", we want to combine them into a single string like \"Hello World\". Let\\'s explore the different methods to insert variables into strings effectively. Using f-strings f-strings (formatted string literals) were introduced in Python 3.6 and have quickly become the most recommended way to insert variables into strings. They are concise, readable and faster than other traditional methods. Python a = \"Python\" res = f \"This is { a } programming!\" print ( res ) Output This is Python programming! Explanation: In an f-string, the variable a is inserted directly by placing it inside {} within a string prefixed with f , enabling dynamic content without manual concatenation. Using format() Before f-strings , the .format() method was the standard way to insert variables into strings. It remains widely used, especially in projects requiring compatibility with Python versions earlier than 3.6. Python a = \"Hello\" b = \"world\" res = \" {} {} \" . format ( a , b ) print ( res ) Output Hello world Explanation: In the format() method, placeholders {} are used inside the string, and variables a and b are inserted by passing them to format(), allowing dynamic content without manual concatenation. Using + operator + operator is a basic method to combine strings and variables, but it can get messy with multiple variables or different data types. Python a = \"Hello\" b = \"World\" res = a + \" \" + b print ( res ) Output Hello World Explanation: Using the + operator, the variables a and b are joined with a space between them, manually concatenating strings to create dynamic content. Using % formatting This method was used in earlier versions of Python and is still supported, but it\\'s less preferred today due to better alternatives like format() and f-strings . Python a = \"Python\" res = \"This is %s programming!\" % a print ( res ) Output This is Python programming! Explanation: In % formatting, the %s placeholder inside the string is replaced by the value of a , allowing variable insertion in a style similar to old C-style formatting.
