          "entity_2": "Accommodations: No accommodations provided, so we should provide recommendations based on major destinations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, etc.) to facilitate accommodation selection in future steps. Consider budget options (hostels, business hotels) and mid-range options. Estimated cost per night is around $75-200 depending on the type of accommodation.",
          "entity_3": "Transportation: No information is provided. Assume Japan Rail Pass for efficient travel between major cities (Tokyo-Kyoto-Nara). Local transportation within cities will rely on subway, buses, and taxis. This will cost $300-500.",
          "entity_4": "Attractions: Need to select attractions in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Nara based on their historical and cultural significance, popularity and proximity. Need to find attractions that complement one another. Will need to incorporate Nara Deer Park to see the deer. Estimated cost is $100 per day for attraction entrance fees.",
          "entity_5": "Nara Deer: Need to make sure to include locations in the itinerary where deer are found. They're primarily concentrated in Nara Park. We should also incorporate the Kasuga Taisha Shrine area, as that is a prime location for these animals.",
          "entity_6": "Proposal: Need to find a romantic and visually appealing location for the proposal, considering accessibility and the overall itinerary flow. Will need to take into account that these locations may require advance booking or have entry fees.",
          "overall_observations": "The major challenge is the lack of concrete data in the input. Will have to make reasonable assumptions based on publicly available data and general knowledge of Japan travel. The proposed itinerary will include flexible options and estimated costs based on these assumptions. It is important to emphasize this is an approximation, and will need to be modified as more data comes in. Budget range is fairly wide ($2500 - $5000), therefore it is difficult to create one itinerary that is the perfect fit without more specific desires. This itinerary will assume mid-range travel, and will assume a price of $3500."

Its the day trip that goes hand in hand with visiting Osaka and Kyoto , not only because it is one hour away from both areas, but also because its a beautiful getaway from the flashing lights of Osaka and the numerous temples of Kyoto. It still features a little both of both, but the amalgamation of religious shrines and tall mountains in Nara makes it a unique area to explore, whether it be as a quick day trip or slowly over a few days. If youre in it for the long run and want to explore the depths of Nara without having to worry about catching transport back to where you came from, then we highly recommend booking in a ryokan in the area. There are plenty to choose from, and some will even offer the greatest views, most relaxing onsen experiences, and/or memorable kaiseki cuisines you will ever have in Japan. Below weve listed a few of the favourites in Nara, which cover all budgets and all types of travellers. 1.Heijo Are stunning views your cup of tea when traveling? Look no further than Heijo their best asset is most definitely the incredible view of Nara City which stretches far into the horizon. Its one of the most raved on features of this ryokan by past guests, so you can bet you wont be disappointed, especially if youre visiting during special seasons like Cherry Blossom season or Autumn Leaves season. Theres a free shuttle bus that will transport you to and from Nara Station on a 10-minute trip. You wont get bored, as there is a summertime outdoor pool to relax by, LCD TVs in all guestrooms, and public onsens to experience. Dine on an incredible kaiseki dinner made with fresh seasonal ingredients, and wake up to a stunning set breakfast. Why Guests Love It : The hotel is located in the mountain which has fresh air and cherry blossoms. In the morning you can drive 10-minutes to the mountain top where there are wild deer, Sakura, and the view of the whole Nara city which is fantastic!, The location of this hotel is wonderful! Amazing view of Nara and Todaiji. The staff are very nice and helpful, and food is awesome. Do not miss the dinner at the hotel, it will be a perfect experience!. Book It Here : Heijo Ryokan 2.Asukasou This conveniently located ryokan offers customers the options of either sleeping on western-style beds, or on Japanese futons. Quality of rooms, however, remain high regardless of which you pick. Tatami mats are present in both styles of rooms, and wooden furnishings complete the western rooms, whilst shoji sliding doors encapsulate the Japanese vibes of the futon rooms. There is a massage service as well as public baths on-site for your comfort, or else reserve the family bath for complete privacy whilst you indulge in the wonderful Japanese experience. If you reserve the Japanese-style guest rooms, a multi-course kaiseki dinner will be served in the privacy of your room.

Tokyo to Nara train with JR pass (and cost without) Japan travel blog Hi there! So you want to go from Tokyo to Nara! As an ancient capital of Japan, Nara can be a good place to go for some history and culture. This city is also where youll find the nearly 50 foottall Great Buddha, the largest bronze statue of Buddha in Japan. Powered by GetYourGuide Oh, and the deer. Nara is also very well-known for the deer. You will see them everywhere. If youll be making your way to the top attractions of Nara , you wont have to go searching for deer. They are all around. Side note! Read the reviews for uniquely-Japan experiences ! (Partner website reviews!) So now Is it easy to get from Tokyo to Nara by train? It can be pretty easy. Its also easy (and common) to make it a day trip to Nara from Kyoto or from Osaka if you want to spend extra time either of these cities. The best way to get from Tokyo to Nara because of the long distance is in part by the fast shinkansen bullet train. But there is no shinkansen station in Nara, which means that whether you travel with or without a JR pass, you need one train transfer. With the JR pass, there is a specific train that youll need to take, but there are still frequent enough timings of trains running between Tokyo and Nara that its pretty convenient. If youre looking to get to Nara using your JR pass, you basically have one option that youll want to take. If you dont have a JR pass, you have a few options to get from Tokyo to Nara by train: Shinkansen bullet train + JR train (JR pass option) Shinkansen bullet train + Kintetsu train Train stations to know about In Tokyo, there are 2 shinkansen stations: Tokyo station Shinagawa station Youll be transferring in Kyoto when you take the shinkansen: Kyoto train station In Nara, there are 2 train stations in separate locations: JR Nara station Kintetsu Nara station How to get from Tokyo to Nara with a Japan rail pass Cost with JR pass: FREE! SHINKANSEN BULLET TRAIN + JR RAPID TRAIN Tokyo to Kyoto: Hikari shinkansen (2 hr 40 min) Short walk at Kyoto station from the shinkansen line to the JR line Kyoto to Nara: JR rapid train (45 min) Total time: Around 3 hours 45 minutes from start to finish including transfer time Its possible to travel from Tokyo to Nara by using the JR pass only, so you wont have to pay anything extra! The one small downside of the JR pass is that you cant use the pass to take the fastest Nozomi shinkansen. So youll have to be sure to get on the Hikari. In terms of time it takes, the Hikari will get you from Tokyo to Kyoto 20 minutes slower compared to the Hikari. Similarly in Nara, you cant take the fastest train from Kyoto to Nara , and you need to make sure you take a train on the JR line. The JR rapid train that you take will get you to Nara around 10 minutes slower compared to fastest Kintetsu train. How much does it cost to get to Nara from Tokyo WITHOUT a Japan rail pass? Now, lets say youre trying to figure out if you should have your JR pass activated when you go to Nara, or you wont be traveling around Japan at all with a JR pass. Listed prices are approximate just so you can start to get at least a little bit of an idea. These are your main options. Option 1: Nozomi shinkansen + Kintetsu limited express Cost: 15,040 yen (US$132) SHINKANSEN BULLET TRAIN + KINTETSU LIMITED EXPRESS TRAIN Tokyo to Kyoto: Nozomi shinkansen (2 hr 20 min) Short walk at Kyoto station from the shinkansen line to the Kintestu line Kyoto to Kintetsu Nara station: Kintetsu limited express train (35 min) Total time: Around 3 hours 5 minutes from start to finish including transfer time This is the fastest way to get to Nara', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.flashpackingjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/backpacking-japan-travel-blog-foreigners-alone-solo-itinerary-.png', 'alt_text': 'Flashpacking Japan', 'width': '799', 'height': '156', 'class': 'kad-standard-logo', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.flashpackingjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tokyo-to-nara-train-with-jr-pass-nara-things-to-do-in-nara-ancient-capital-city-.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Tokyo to Nara train with JR pass.

The Nozomi is the fastest bullet train available on this route, though if you have a Japan Rail Pass youll be limited to the very slightly slower Hikari and other models. The slowest Shink is the Kodamaits an old model that takes upwards of 3.5 hours to make the journey from Tokyo to Kyoto. In general, this slowpoke is best avoided, but taking it can be a way to save money. See below for more on that.

No matter which mode of transportation you choose, it would continue to head to Nara after reaching Kyoto or you have to transfer at Kyoto Station. As thus, there are 3 main ways from Tokyo to Nara. JR Train Platform Best Choice: Tokyo to Kyoto Shinkansen + Kyoto to Nara Train, 3-4h & JPY 14,590 Shinkansen Station Hall There is no Shinkansen train directly to Nara, thus passengers have to transfer in Kyoto if setting off from Tokyo. As the 2-2.5h Shinkansen train reaches Kyoto (JPY 13,870 for an unreserved seat), its recommended to take a limited express train to Nara. See also: Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto Why Not transfer in Osaka? Its practicable to transfer in Osaka without doubt. However, it will be a detour if you dont get off the Shinkansen train at Kyoto Station but continue the trip until Shin-Osaka Station. Besides, there is no direct train from Shin-Osaka Sta. to Nara, it would be a little complicated to travel to Osaka Station firstly. Differently, you can get a limited express train to Nara straight at Kyoto Station. Also, Kintetsu Kyoto Station is just next to JR Kyoto Station. Kyoto to Nara Trains: 34-77min & JPY 720 at least JR Kintetsu Railway Time Needed 44-77min 34-36min Frequency Every 7-24 minutes (weekdays) Every 8-12 minutes (weekends) 2-4 trains every hour First Train 05:33 06:55 Last Train 23:46 23:22 Ticket Fare JPY 720 JPY 1,280 Nara Line Board Notes: Shinkansen trains from Tokyo stop at JR Kyoto Sta., while Kintetsu Kyoto Station stand by the Hachijo-guchi Exit of JR Kyoto Sta. in the south. Kintetsu Nara Station is quite close to the major scenic spots in Nara, the Nara Park area. JR Nara Station is somewhat farther away from the area. Alternative: Tokyo to Osaka Flight + Airport Train/Bus to Nara, overall 4h & JPY 12,000 at least In Osaka, Kansai International Airport is nearer to Nara compared with Itami Airport. It takes 1.5 hours or so from Tokyo to Kansai Airport, and the flights from Haneda Airport are almost twice as many as these from Narita Airport . However, the flights from Narita Airport, almost all budget flights, are cheaper. See more details about Tokyo to Osaka Flights Kansai Airport to Nara Trains: around 1.5h & JPY 1,650-3,030 To JR Nara Sta. To Kintetsu Nara Sta. Route Kansai Airport - Tennoji Nara (JR lines all the way) Kansai Airport - Osaka-Namba - Kintetsu Nara (Nankai Electric Railway Kintetsu Railway) Time Consumed 32-55min to Tennoji Sta.; 33-37min from Tennoji to JR Nara; 1h 17-33min in total 1h 25-42min First Train 05:50 from Kansai Airport (for Tennoji) 05:45 (weekdays) / 05:47 (weekends & holidays) for Nankai Namba Sta.

Unryuin Temple A Serene Space with a Touch of Zen Just a short distance from Kyoto Station, Unryuin Temple is surprisingly easy to reachand yet, remarkably peaceful. Originally built in 1372, it belongs to the Shingon Buddhist sect and is also known as a branch of the more famous Sennyuji Temple, often called the Temple of the Imperial Family. Step into the main hall, and you can even try shakyo (sutra copying) while sipping on matchaan immersive way to experience Kyotos spiritual traditions firsthand. The temple is also known for two standout features: A dramatic dragon painting on the fusuma (sliding doors), which also graces the front of their goshuin stamp book. The Window of Enlightenment and Window of Confusion a circular and a square window symbolizing Zen concepts. During fall, the view through them framed with red maple leaves is absolutely stunning. Address: 36 Sennyuji Yamanochi-cho, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto Hours: 9:0017:00 (last entry 16:30) Closed: Wednesdays (open daily in November) Access: About a 15-minute walk from the Sennyuji-michi city bus stop Website: Unryuin 2. Genkoan Temple A Window into the Mind Head north to the quieter outskirts of Kyoto and youll find Genkoan Temple , originally founded in 1346. The temple belongs to the Soto Zen school and can be reached in one bus ride from Kyoto Station. It shares the same concept as Unryuin with its famous Windows of Enlightenment and Confusion. Only these two temples in all of Kyoto feature this rare pair, making them extra special. The round window represents enlightenment and harmony. The square window reflects human life, full of struggles and distractions. You might find yourself gazing through them, reflecting on your own path. Inside the main hall, look up to see the hauntingly named Blood Ceiling. Its a memorial to fallen samurai, using floorboards from a castle siege that now watch silently overhead.

If so, Deer Park might well be the place for you and your family (and your dog). With its grass pitches, this pop-up site on a farm in Devon is a great option for wild camping. However, don't fret if you cant cope without the occasional treat (whether an Indian meal or a well-stocked supermarket) the market town of Holsworthy is only a five-minute drive away along the A3072. \\r \\r Before you opt for the convenience of a supermarket, though, consider taking advantage of the on-site services, such as the breakfast basket, stuffed full of local produce and delivered to your pitch. Deer Park also has hot-water showers and portable toilets, but be aware that there is no drinking water here, so those supermarkets will come in quite handy after all\\r \\r Stroll around the farm getting to know the resident cows and taking in the rural landscape, play the 18 holes at neighbouring Holsworthy Golf Club (a 20-minute walk away) or head to the coast for a little watersports action. Since the site is in western Devon, youre actually closer to north Cornish beaches such as sandy Widemouth (20 minutes drive). Dogs are allowed at Black Rock (20 minutes), where they (as well as the kids) might enjoy splashing around the shallow rockpools. Both beaches are renowned surfing spots, as is wide Summerleaze Beach in Bude (20 minutes). The South West Coast Path runs along the entire coastline, making it possible to experience this rugged area from the top of vertiginous cliffs.

The semi-wild deer roam around the park freely and interacting with them can be lots of fun. Also scattered around the 1,600-acre Nara Park are a bunch of old temples and shrines from hundreds of years ago, when Nara was the ancient capital of Japan. For us, the highlight of the park (aside from feeding the deer) would have to be the huge Todaiji Temple, one of the most spectacular monuments weve seen in Japan. A final plus is that Nara is easy to visit from Osaka and Kyoto, two other Japanese tourism hotspots. This travel guide will explain how to get to the Nara Park, and everything you need to know before you go!

Theyre semi-wild, but friendly, and the park has special cracker stands where you can buy a pack of healthy crackers for 200 Yen and hand feed them to the deer. Some of the deer at the park have even learned to nod their heads (like theyre bowing) as a trick to earn the crackers! In Japan, even the animals know their manners. Feeding the deer Its a good idea to break the crackers into pieces so they last longer and you get more photos. After you run out of crackers, you can show the deer your empty hands so they know the food is all gone, otherwise they may get pushy for more. We didnt see any aggressive behavior from the deer in two visits to Nara, but it does happen sometimes and people can get hurt. Just make sure you dont tease the deer by hiding food behind your back or holding it away from them, otherwise they can get annoyed. Overall, its a unique and fun experience that I cant say Ive heard of anywhere else!

Were so excited for you to embark on this next chapter with your lifelong partner. If proposals are on your mind, Japan is definitely one of the best places to do so. Here well tell you everything you need to know if youre planning to craft a memorable proposal on your trip to Japan! Dont miss the end of the article, we recommend you great photographers in Japan to capture this special moment. Is Japan a good place to propose? The short answer is: Yes, absolutely! Japan is one of peoples top destinations for a reason. With its mix of modern wonders, traditional architecture, and natural beauty, Japan stands out as one of the best places to visit if you want to make a big impression. Thats what makes it such a perfect place for proposals! When proposing, its not only the location that you need to take note of but also the right moment. After all, you wouldnt want to time your proposal wrong! Whether your planned proposal is more of an intimate moment or a grand gesture, we have a wide selection of places in Japan to suit your needs. From classic spots that deserve to be called iconic in their own right, to hidden gems just waiting to be discovered, weve listed 15 gorgeous spots for a once-in-a-lifetime memorable proposal. Where to propose in Japan? The 15 Best Spots 1. Mt. Fuji Of course, we have to start with the iconic Mt. Fuji. It is part of Japans Three Holy Mountains along with Mount Haku and Mount Tate. But among these three, Mt. Fuji definitely stands out as one of the most iconic symbols of the country. Located about 100 KM (62 miles) from Tokyo, its perfect shape and glorious appearance have made it a pilgrimage site for centuries. To this day, Mt. Fuji stands out as one of the most picturesque places in the country. The best part? On clear days, its quite visible from Tokyo! If you dont want to travel outside of the capital, plenty of Tokyo spots offer beautiful views of the mountain, especially on the citys numerous observation decks. A proposal with Mt. Fuji in the background is as classy and timeless as can be. Who knows? Maybe proposing here will mean your future relationship will be as strong and stable as this great mountain! If you decided to propose in Mt Fuji, we highly recommend you to hire this photographer: Proposal Photographer Mount Fuji . His photos are outstanding as you can see below. For more tips, you can also read our full guide on how to propose in Mount Fuji ! 2. Wedded Rocks (Meoto Iwa) The name itself is already making us hear wedding bells. The Meoto Iwa site is located in Mie Prefecture in the Kansai Region, and it is truly a sight to behold. There is something so strangely beautiful and indeed, even sacred about two giant boulders at sea, connected together by a thick rope. This rope isnt any ordinary rope, either its shimenawa rope, believed to connect the spiritual and earthly realms together. These Wedded Rocks stand as a gorgeous spectacle and indeed one of the most memorable places you could begin your next chapter in life. The solemnity of the place paired with the stunning view of the rocky site will definitely make for an intimate yet powerful proposal.

It is important to emphasize this is an approximation, and will need to be modified as more data comes in. Budget range is fairly wide ($2500 - $5000), therefore it is difficult to create one itinerary that is the perfect fit without more specific desires.

In this section, well explain these greetings and commonly used phrases in detail. (Ohayou gozaimasu), (Konnichiwa), (Konbanwa) The phrases (Ohayou gozaimasu) , (Konnichiwa) , and (Konbanwa) are commonly used Japanese greetings. (Ohayou gozaimasu) This is a morning greeting used from sunrise until around 10 a.m. (Konnichiwa) This is a daytime greeting typically used from around 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Konbanwa) After 5 p.m. in the evening, this phrase is the natural choice for greetings.

Its a versatile phrase that can be used in various situations, but during travel, it is mainly used when you want to politely accept or request something that has been suggested. While saying \"\" (hai) to affirm a question is common, it can sometimes come across as cold depending on the context.

(Arigatou gozaimasu) \"\" (arigatou gozaimasu) is the phrase used to express gratitude in Japanese. When someone does something for you, saying \"\" (arigatou gozaimasu) conveys your thanks . Often, the other person will respond with a smile and say, \"\" (iie iie) \"No, no, its nothing\" making for a pleasant interaction. (Mou ichido yoroshii desu ka?) \"\" (mou ichido yoroshii desu ka?) is a useful phrase when you need someone to repeat themselves because their speech was too fast or too complex to understand.
