Want to share a tip or suggestion? Looking for broad recommendations? You've come to the right place! Members Online [deleted] Hotels in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka Recommendations My partner and I are travelling to Japan in 2 weeks for a 1 week stay. We were initially planning on going after our trip to China but it's now been moved up to 2 weeks from now. Our plan is to fly into Tokyo (Haneda), stay for 3 nights and leave for Kyoto on our 4th day. We'll stay in Kyoto for 3 nights (with one of those days spent in Nara), and then travel to Osaka for 2 nights and fly out of Osaka the following day. It's a bit last minute but does anyone have any recommendations for hotels in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka? We're having trouble deciding which town to get a hotel in Tokyo especially (leaning towards Shinjuku maybe?) We also want to spend either our last night in Tokyo or our last night in Kyoto in a ryokan so if anyone has any recommendations for ryokans, that'd be super helpful as well! (My partner has visable tattoos though and is worried about public onsens so it might be better if we went to a ryokan with a private onsen). Our budget for hotels isn't very high, around $70-$100 a night or less. We just need a clean place to sleep and house our luggage. We do want to stay at a nice ryokan so our budget is higher for that. EDIT: Thank you everyone for your suggestions!! We have booked all our hotels! We ended up using the credit card points we saved up for a nearly free stay at a nicer hotel in Tokyo and were able to find hotels in Kyoto and Osaka that fit our budget! We decided to splurge on a ryokan that overlooks Lake Biwa on our last night in Kyoto. I'm sooo excited for this trip! Read more Share Share New to Reddit?

It is one of Tokyo 's most colorful and popular temples. The legend says that in the year 628 , two brothers fished a statue of Kannon , the goddess of mercy, out of the Sumida River, and even though they put the statue back into the river, it always returned to them. Consequently, Sensoji was built nearby for the goddess of Kannon. The temple was completed in 645, making it Tokyo 's oldest temple. Main Hall When approaching the temple, visitors first enter through the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate), the outer gate of Sensoji Temple and the symbol of Asakusa and the entire city of Tokyo . A shopping street of over 200 meters, called Nakamise , leads from the outer gate to the temple's second gate, the Hozomon. Alongside typical Japanese souvenirs such as yukata and folding fans, various traditional local snacks from the Asakusa area are sold along the Nakamise. The shopping street has a history of several centuries. View of the Nakamise from above Beyond the Hozomon Gate stands the temple 's main hall and a five storied pagoda. Destroyed in the war, the buildings are relatively recent reconstructions. The Asakusa Shrine , built in the year 1649 by Tokugawa Iemitsu , stands immediately adjacent to the temple's main building. Various events are held throughout the year in the Sensoji Temple area. The biggest of them is the Sanja Matsuri , the annual festival of the Asakusa Shrine, held in May. Other events are the Asakusa Samba Carnival in August and the Hagoita-ichi (Hagoita Market) at which decorated wooden paddles used in the traditional game of hanetsuki are sold.

With a bit of effort, visitors in wheelchairs can see the first stretch of the path and the first two shrines. Background Information Founded in the early 700s and covering an entire mountain, Fushimi Inari is one of Kyotos largest and oldest Shinto shrines. The buildings you can see there today are from later periods, but the shrine grounds were been spared from the fires that ravaged Kyoto throughout the centuries, so the complex retains a very traditional layout and atmosphere. The Fushimi neighborhood surrounding the shrine is well known for its clear water, making it a center for sake production. This is a fitting location for the shrine, as the goddess enshrined here is an ancient rice deity connected to business, agriculture, and of course alcohol. Pairs of fox statues cover the mountain, animal messengers of the rice goddess after whom the mountain is named. And make no mistake about the size of this complex; it is a mountain. Most visitors come here to see the tunnels of thousands of orange torii gates that snake up the hillside. The full hike through the tunnels can take hours and involves numerous steps and slopes, but making your way through the first few sets of gates and into the inner okusha shrine will give you can excellent taste of what the mountain has to offer. Fushimi Inari Shrine is open 24/7 year round. It gets extremely busy during the day, but arriving before 9am or after 4pm usually allows for thinner crowds. However, please note that the elevator to the Torii Gate paths is only available between 9:00-15:00. Getting There You can get to Fushimi Inari Shrine via JR Inari Station located right next to the shrine, or Fushimi Inari Station (Keihan Main Line) which is a short walk from the shrine. Both stations are wheelchair accessible. Accessibility As mentioned above, the best strategy for visiting Fushimi Inari Shrine is to go outside of peak hours. The crowds can be a bit overwhelming and make it difficult to move around. Before going to the rows of torii gates, you should visit the main shrine. The path from the main gate to the temple is smooth and easy to move on, but there is a set of stairs leading up to the main shrine hall. Heading to the left there are two other sets of stairs, but this time built with ramps. Unfortunately, the ramps are a bit steep and wheelchair users may want some assistance to get up. Once at the main shrine hall area, there are a few buildings to see including the shrine itself and a stage for traditional dances', 'images': [{'url': 'https://accessible-japan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fushimi-inari-side-ramp.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ramp up stairs to Fushimi Inari Shrine', 'width': '840', 'height': '472', 'class': 'aligncenter size-full wp-image-4643', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://accessible-japan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fushimi-inari-main-shrine.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Fushimi Inari Shrine main hall', 'width': '840', 'height': '472', 'class': 'aligncenter size-full wp-image-4638', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://accessible-japan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fushimi-elevator.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Elevator at Fushimi Inari Taisha', 'width': '1140', 'height': '641', 'class': 'aligncenter wp-image-9292 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://accessible-japan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fushimi-inari-gates.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Line to go through gates at Fushimi Inari Shrine', 'width': '840', 'height': '472', 'class': 'aligncenter size-full wp-image-4637', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://accessible-japan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fushimi-inari-shrine-return-path.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Fushimi Inari Shrine return path', 'width': '840', 'height': '472', 'class': 'aligncenter size-full wp-image-4645', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.agoda.com/travel-guides/japan/kyoto/fushimi-inari-opening-hours-best-times-for-sunrise-magic/', 'content': \"Fushimi Inari Opening Hours: Best Times for Sunrise Magic Agoda: See The World For Less Rooms Flights Today's deals Search travel guides Home Travel Guides Japan Kyoto Fushimi Inari Opening Hours: Best Times for Sunrise Magic Home Travel-guides Japan Fushimi Inari Opening Hours: Best Times for Sunrise Magic Fushimi Inari Opening Hours: Best Times for Sunrise Magic Last Updated: March 14, 2025 Introduction Fushimi Inari Shrine, with its mesmerizing rows of vibrant torii gates , is one of Kyotos most iconic landmarks.

It is famous for its thousands of vermilion torii gates , which straddle a network of trails behind its main buildings. The trails lead into the wooded forest of the sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine grounds. Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes are thought to be Inari\\'s messengers, resulting in many fox statues across the shrine grounds. Fushimi Inari Shrine has ancient origins, predating the capital\\'s move to Kyoto in 794. A giant torii gate in front of the Romon Gate at the shrine\\'s entrance While the primary reason most foreign visitors come to Fushimi Inari Shrine is to explore the mountain trails, the shrine buildings themselves are also attractive. At the shrine\\'s entrance stands the Romon Gate, which was donated in 1589 by the famous leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi . Behind stands the shrine\\'s main hall (honden) where all visitors are encouraged to pay respect to the resident deity by making a small offering. At the very back of the shrine\\'s main grounds is the entrance to the torii gate-covered hiking trail, which starts with two dense, parallel rows of gates called Senbon Torii (\"thousands of torii gates\"). The torii gates along the entire trail are donations by individuals and companies, and you will find the donator\\'s name and the date of the donation inscribed on the back of each gate. The donation amount starts around 400,000 yen for a smaller gate and increases to over one million yen for a large gate. The two dense rows of torii gates of Senbon Torii The hike to the summit of the mountain and back takes about 2-3 hours, however, visitors are free to walk just as far as they wish before turning back. Along the way, there are multiple smaller shrines with stacks of miniature torii gates that were donated by visitors with smaller budgets.

Nio-mon This is the main entrance of Kiyomizu-dera Temple. It was burnt down during a civil war in 1469 and reconstructed around 1500. In 2003, the gate was taken apart and refurbished. This magnificent two-story gate measures approximately 10 meters wide, 5 meters long, and 14 meters high, and displays unique features of the era when it was rebuilt. 2. Sai-mon (West gate) The present building was reconstructed in 1633. With the spectacular views of the sunset from the site of Sai-mon, it has long been considered a gateway to Paradise and is known as a sacred place for Nissokan , one of the meditation practices for visualizing the Pure Land. Nissokan 3. Zuigu-do Hall This building was constructed in 1735. The principal image of this hall is the Daizuigu Bodhisattva (a hidden Buddhist image), which kindly hears the desires and aspirations of each and every person. Shinto and Buddhist deities of matchmaking, safe birth, and child rearing are also enshrined here. The special tour for exploring the sanctified area underneath the hall, called Tainai meguri , is also offered here. *Please note that the Tainai meguri tour is currently being run with a smaller number of participants due to the current pandemic. 4. Hondo (Main hall) The Main Hall in Kiyomizu-dera Temple, which stands on the steep cliff of Mt. Otowa, is a renowned wooden structure reconstructed in 1633. The principal image of Kiyomizu, the statue of the Eleven-headed Thousand-armed Kannon Bodhisattva is enshrined in the innermost section of the Hall. Using a traditional Japanese method of construction, it was built solidly enough to support the stage, which is always bustling with many visitors. Learn more about the Main Hall 5. Okuno-in Hall Okuno-in Hall stands directly above Otowa Waterfall. The present building was rebuilt at the same time as the Main Hall in 1633. Okuno-in also boasts a spacious stage constructed using a unique method, just like the Main Hall. The stunning view of the Main Hall stage and the Kyoto cityscape from here make it a favorite photo opportunity for visitors. 6. Otowa no taki (Otowa Waterfall) Kiyomizu-dera Temple originates from Otowa Waterfall and takes its name from the pureness of the waters. The clear, gushing waters have long been called Konjiki-sui (golden water) or Enmei-sui (life-prolonging water) and are suitable for use in purification. Visitors catch each of the three streams of pure water with ladles and pray for purification of their six senses and to make their wishes come true. 7. Jojuin Jojuin was originally built as a living quarters for the venerable Gana, a priest who had long devoted himself to the reestablishment of Kiyomizu-dera Temple after it was burnt down during the war. Years later, the building was used as the main sub-temple of Kiyomizu for maintenance of the temple buildings and to manage the temples finances. Jojuin is also renowned for its exquisite Moon Garden, which is specially opened to the public for a limited time each year.

In particular, during the special nighttime viewing, the illuminated main hall and Kiyomizu stage are enveloped in a fantastic atmosphere, showing a different look from the daytime. Please keep the following points in mind when visiting the shrine. Admission fees are paid on the day and no reservations are required. You can enter smoothly even when it is crowded. The special nighttime viewing sessions tend to get particularly crowded, so the best time to go is right after they begin. It is especially popular during the autumn foliage and cherry blossom seasons, so we recommend visiting early.

The temple is part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto UNESCO World Heritage site. While there are some practical challenges for disabled visitors, the temple has put in a lot of work to be as wheelchair accessible as possible. Background Kiyomizu-dera was estableshed during the early Heian period (794-1185) by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro in 778. The current buildings were constructed in 1633 under the orders of Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu. There is not a single nail used in the entire structure. The temples name means pure water , or clear water , and takes its name from the clear waters of Otowa Waterfall. Kiyomizudera is best known for its wooden stage that is built out from the main building. 13 meters above the hillside below, the stage gives visitors a nice view of the city below, and countless cherry and maple trees that provide breathtaking scenes of color in spring and fall. The main hall houses the temples primary object of worship, a small statue of the eleven faced, thousand armed Kannon. There are many other shrines and halls around the complex. Kiyomizu-dera and other temples in the area are lit up in the evening during the annual Hanatoro event held in mid-March to mid-April. Kiyomizu-dera also has special lighting during the fall season in the second half of November. The path leading up to the temple is bustling with shops and restaurants that have been serving tourists and pilgrims for centuries. You can buy everything from standard souvenirs to local sweets, pickled vegetables, and Kiyomizu-yaki pottery. The temple is open daily from 6:00-18:00 (or 18:30 on weekends and holidays from mid-April until July, and then every day in August and September). For the special light-up events from mid-March to mid-April, and mid-November to early December, the temple stays open until 21:00. The entrance fee is 400 yen, but it may be waived with disability identification. Getting There Kiyomizu-dera can be accessed from Kyoto Station by bus numbers 100 or 206, and getting off atat Gojo-zaka or Kiyomizu-michi bus stops. From there it is a 10-minute walk uphill to the temple. While the Kiyomizu-Gojo station is an alternative option, it is 20-minute walk (including 10-minutes uphill). Bus are wheelchair accessible, but since they can be very crowded, it can be easier to get on at the starting point of a route (like Kyoto station) than mid-way through the route.

History of Kinkaku-ji The original structure of Kinkaku-ji was erected in 1397. It adheres to the Shoku-ji branch of Rinzai Zen, founded by Muso Soseki during the Muromachi Period. The building itself was first a villa owned by court noble . Later, it was used as a retirement home by a well-known shogun. Finally, at his request his son converted the structure into a Zen temple, naming it Rokuonji. This temple was destroyed several times by the fires of wartime. A similar temple, the Ginkaku-ji or Silver Pavilion , was built by the shoguns grandson on the other side of Kyoto a few decades later. In 1950, Kinkaku-ji was burned to the ground by a disgruntled young Buddhist monk. This event and the temple itself served as the setting for Yukio Mishimas 1956 novel, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion . Kinkaku-ji was rebuilt in 1955, and additional gold leaf was added in 1987 .

Formally known as Rokuonji, the temple was the retirement villa of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu , and according to his will it became a Zen temple of the Rinzai sect after his death in 1408. Kinkakuji was the inspiration for the similarly named Ginkakuji (Silver Pavilion) , built by Yoshimitsu's grandson, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, on the other side of the city a few decades later. Kinkakuji is an impressive structure built overlooking a large pond, and is the only building left of Yoshimitsu's former retirement complex. It has burned down numerous times throughout its history including twice during the Onin War , a civil war that destroyed much of Kyoto; and once again more recently in 1950 when it was set on fire by a fanatic monk. The present structure was rebuilt in 1955. Each floor has a different architectural style Kinkakuji was built to echo the extravagant Kitayama culture that developed in the wealthy aristocratic circles of Kyoto during Yoshimitsu's times. Each floor represents a different style of architecture . The first floor is built in the Shinden style used for palace buildings during the Heian Period , and with its natural wood pillars and white plaster walls contrasts yet complements the gilded upper stories of the pavilion. Statues of the Shaka Buddha (historical Buddha) and Yoshimitsu are stored in the first floor. Although it is not possible to enter the pavilion, the statues can be viewed from across the pond if you look closely, as the sliding doors are usually left open. The second floor is built in the Bukke style used in samurai residences, and has its exterior completely covered in gold leaf. Inside is a seated Kannon Bodhisattva surrounded by statues of the Four Heavenly Kings; however, the statues are not shown to the public. Finally, the third and uppermost floor is built in the style of a Chinese Zen Hall, is gilded inside and out, and is capped with a golden phoenix. The head priest's former living quarters (hojo) After viewing Kinkakuji from across the pond, visitors pass by the head priest's former living quarters (hojo) which are known for their painted sliding doors (fusuma), but are not open to the public. The path once again passes by Kinkakuji from behind then leads through the temple's gardens which have retained their original design from Yoshimitsu's days. The gardens hold a few other spots of interest including Anmintaku Pond that is said to never dry up, and statues that people throw coins at for luck. Continuing through the garden takes you to the Sekkatei Teahouse, added to Kinkakuji during the Edo Period , before you exit the paid temple area. Outside the exit are souvenir shops, a small tea garden, where you can have matcha tea and sweets , and Fudo Hall, a small temple hall which houses a statue of Fudo Myoo, one of the Five Wisdom Kings and protector of Buddhism . The statue is said to be carved by Kobo Daishi, one of the most important figures in Japanese religious history.

Nearby Attractions and Itinerary Around Kinkakuji Temple Authentic Tea Ceremony Experience at Nakamura Tokichi in Uji, Kyoto Introduction to Kinkakuji Temple Kinkakuji Temple , formally known as Rokuonji Temple , is one of the sub-temples of the prestigious Shokokuji Temple. It is particularly renowned for its Golden Pavilion . Approximately 600 years ago, the noble Kitayama West Palace, located in Kyoto\\'s northern hills, fell from power following a regime change. The estate and gardens were subsequently transferred to the Muromachi Shogunate, a military government. In 1397, the third shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408), commenced the construction of the Kitayama Palace and the Golden Pavilion. Following its completion, Yoshimitsu spent his final years here before his passing. In accordance with his wishes, the estate was converted into a Zen temple. The renowned monk Muso Soseki was invited to establish the temple, which was named \"Rokuonji\" after Yoshimitsu\\'s posthumous name, \"Rokuon-in-dono.\" In the wake of Yoshimitsu\\'s passing, apart from the Golden Pavilion, the living quarters were either dismantled and donated to Nanzenji or Kenninji temples. Despite enduring the upheavals of the late Muromachi and early Sengoku periods, the Golden Pavilion remained unscathed. During the Edo period (1603-1868), it was rebuilt under the auspices of the Nishi Honganji Temple at the behest of the Tokugawa shogunate. With the onset of the Meiji era, substantial landholdings were reclaimed due to the anti-Buddhist movements, severely impacting the temple\\'s financial resources. Consequently, in 1894, it was opened to the public, and an admission fee was introduced to sustain operations.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION Situated in the foothills off the main tourist area in Arashiyama, this famous bamboo grove is one of Kyotos most visited locations. The forest itself is comprised of several main groves, but the most celebrated is the westernmost one located behind Tenryuji Zen temple. The tall bamboo here is particularly nice on sunny, breezy days when you can experience komorebi a Japanese word used to describe soft, dappled light as it filters through leaves and branches. This special spot is what the edges of Kyoto used to look like before the city expanded, but the bamboo forest is not a wild forest nowadays. There are groups of local volunteers who show up every few weeks to care for the trees, repair the fences, and remove old growth. The bamboo itself is used in local crafts that you can find in shops along the main street in Arashiyama. At certain times of year, lights are installed along the path to illuminate the bamboo at night. Youll probably spot some locals dressed up in kimonos taking pictures, as this is a very popular spot for domestic tourism as well. About half way into the forest from the main street is Nonomiya Jinja. This small Shinto shrine deep in the bamboo used to be a training location for imperial daughters who were chosen to become priestesses at various shrines throughout Japan. Because of this, its a popular spot for young girls to visit nowadays and pray for good luck in finding love and prosperity. Even without going up the main steps, you can see inside the shrine through the trees and watch locals writing their wishes on wooden boards and buying lucky charms to take home. Take note of the torii gate at the entrance to the shrine. Its the only one in the country made of unfinished, rough wood with the bark still attached. GETTING THERE The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove can be accessed from either Hankyus Arashiyama Station , or JRs Saga-Arashiyama Station . Both stations are fully accessible, including accessible toilets and elevators. Click on the station name to see a station map. ACCESSIBILITY The grove itself is smooth and paved and is an easy ride for wheelchair users. There are some sloping areas and crowding in areas, but nothing that should cause difficulty.

Matcha Tea Ceremony Class View fullsize Matt Vachon, Tea Whisk There are few experiences as quintessentially Japanese as taking part in a matcha tea ceremony. Participation can be a bit more complicated than simply drinking tea. In a formal ceremony, guests are expected to follow a certain set of procedures in order for everything to progress smoothly, and most importantly, to pay proper respect to the host. For those interested in joining a tea ceremony for the first time, a visit to Jinmatsuan is the perfect place to start. View fullsize Matt Vachon, Tea Ceremony Instructions In this small cultural center, visitors can take part in every aspect of a matcha tea ceremony , all under the direction of an experienced tea master in a no-pressure environment. During the roughly 45 minute course, guests can get hands-on with not just the tea ceremony itself, but some of the lesser-experienced, behind the scenes work that goes into hosting a tea ceremony. First, participants will learn about ohigashi , a traditional Japanese sweet served alongside matcha to help balance its bitterness. Using an incredibly fine sugar known as wasanbon and wooden molds, guests will create their own ohigashi to be eaten later . View fullsize Matt Vachon, Grinding Matcha Next, participants can try their hand at making matcha , using a heavy granite wheel to grind tea leaves into a fine, bright green powder. Once the matcha powder and ohigashi are ready, visitors are taken to a tatami mat room where the tea master will demonstrate the proper way to whisk matcha for a perfect frothy consistency. View fullsize Matt Vachon, Matcha Bowls For a truly unforgettable time, guests can even book a matcha tea ceremony course with a Maiko , a young geisha in training.

See all results for in Spring Kasugataisha Shrine Kasugataisha Shrine The approach to Naras most famous and impressive Shinto shrine takes you along an atmospheric forest path, lined with hundreds of stone lanterns. Everywhere you will come across the sacred deer that serve the Shinto deities of the Kasugataisha Shrine. Entering the main shrine area, you are immediately struck by the vermillion columns of the shrine buildings, with contrasting white walls and roofs made of cedar bark. One the right side, there is a long cloisters hung with bronze lanterns, many dedicated by famous historical figures. If you pay the entrance fee, you can enter the main shrine building, and see the lanterns up close. Dont miss the Fujinami-no-ya hall directly behind the main shrine in the North cloister, which is lit by hundreds of flickering lanterns. It gives you a feel of how the Shrine looks in February and August during the Mantoro Festival, when around 3,000 lanterns, from the stone toro lining the paths through the forest to the bronze lanterns hung throughout the shrine, are lit up from sunset. Visitors can join morning prayers (omairi) at 9:00 every day. The shrine was built in 768 by the Fujiwara clan, which dominated Japanese politics until the 11th century. There are four main deities enshrined, including Takemikazuchi no Mikoto who, according to legend, traveled from Ibaraki in Northern Japan on a white deer to dwell on Mt Mikasa, above the shrine. Since then, the deer have been considered sacred. The wisteria flower (the family crest of the Fujiwara family) and the deer are the main motifs of the shrine, appearing on carvings throughout the complex. In May, the shrine also draws visitors to see over 200 wisteria trees in full bloom. Just near the shrine entrance, Kasugataisha Shrine Museum has an excellent collection of some of the most important swords, suits of armor and other items dedicated to the deities since the 8th century. There are paths leading through the park to Mt Wakakusa, Todaiji Temple and Kohfukuji Temple. Behind Kasugataisha Shrine, the sacred Kasugayama Primeval Forest has remained untouched for over 1,000 years.

The temple was constructed in 752 as the head temple of all provincial Buddhist temples of Japan and grew so powerful that the capital was moved away from Nara in 784 in order to lower the temple\\'s influence on government affairs. Until recently, Todaiji\\'s main hall, the Daibutsuden (Big Buddha Hall), held the record as the world\\'s largest wooden building, despite the fact that the present reconstruction of 1692 is only two thirds of the original temple hall\\'s size. The massive building houses one of Japan\\'s largest bronze statues of Buddha (Daibutsu). The 15 meters tall, seated Buddha represents Vairocana and is flanked by two Bodhisattvas. Big Buddha (Daibutsu) - his open hand alone is as tall as a human being Several smaller Buddhist statues and models of the former and current buildings are also on display in the Daibutsuden Hall. Another popular attraction is a pillar with a hole in its base that is the same size as the Daibutsu\\'s nostril. It is said that those who can squeeze through this opening will be granted enlightenment in their next life. Along the approach to Todaiji stands the Nandaimon Gate , a large wooden gate watched over by two fierce looking statues. Representing the Nio Guardian Kings, the statues are designated national treasures together with the gate itself. Temple visitors will also encounter some deer from the adjacent Nara Park , begging for shika senbei, special crackers for deer that are sold for around 200 yen. Deer in front of the Nandaimon Gate Todaiji\\'s grounds are spacious and cover most of northern Nara Park , including a number of smaller temple halls and sites of interest around the Daibutsuden Hall.

Known for its UNESCO World Heritage Sites , temples, and polite deer (yes - they bow!) that roam freely through the citys national park, Nara offers a picturesque and romantic setting for couples seeking an unforgettable elopement. Whether youre drawn to its cultural significance or its natural beauty, Nara provides the perfect blend of tranquility and historical charm for a perfectly intimate and memorable elopement experience. One of the most enchanting ways to elope in Nara is with a semi-private ceremony in an old tea house , hidden within a beautifully landscaped Japanese garden . This serene setting not only embodies the elegance of Japanese culture but also offers a tranquil escape from the bustling world outside, making it the perfect spot for a romantic and personal ceremony. A Tea House Ceremony: Tranquility and Tradition Imagine exchanging vows in a traditional tea house, where the sliding wooden doors open to reveal a meticulously designed garden. This intimate setting, with its simple yet elegant architecture, creates a peaceful ambiance that allows the focus to remain on the couple. The soft rustling of leaves and the gentle fragrance of blooming flowers add a layer of sensory delight to the moment. Naras gardens are renowned for their seasonal beauty , offering a range of backdrops that change throughout the year. In spring, the public parks burst into life with cherry blossoms , early summer sees fresh greens and colourful blooms, while autumn brings a cascade of crimson and gold as the leaves change color all across the region. No matter the season, the tea house and its surrounding gardens provide an exquisite setting that evokes a sense of timeless romance. After the ceremony, the garden and park offers countless opportunities for stunning photos. The contrast of the couple's attire against the greenery, the stone paths winding through the landscape, and the reflections in the water all create visually captivating moments. The garden setting is both intimate and grand, making it perfect for capturing the essence of a private elopement. Nara Park: A Magical Setting for Photos Following the ceremony, a short stroll takes you to the iconic Nara Park , home to the citys famous deer and several of its most renowned landmarks. The park's expansive greenery, dotted with historic temples such as Todai-ji and Kasuga Taisha , can serve as a breathtaking backdrop for post-ceremony photos. You might find yourselves walking hand-in-hand along the park's scenic paths, the ancient temples rising in the background while the gentle deer wander nearby, adding an almost magical quality to your wedding portraits. Sunset on Mount Wakakusa: A Breathtaking Finale To cap off your elopement in Nara, head to Mount Wakakusa , a small mountain located just behind Nara Park. A taxi ride to the top is well worth it, especially if timed with sunset. From this peaceful vantage point, youll enjoy a panoramic view of the city below , with the golden hues of the setting sun casting a warm glow over the rooftops, temples, and distant hills. Imagine capturing your final wedding photos as the sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in soft shades of pink, orange, and violet . This elevated setting provides a sense of calm and wonder, perfect for reflecting on the beginning of your journey together. Why Elope in Nara? Eloping in Nara offers couples the chance to experience Japans ancient history and natural beauty in a deeply personal way. The combination of a semi-private tea house ceremony , the historic charm of Nara Park , and the breathta\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e36c1_ca26d0c0d90c4261a955f52870b1808c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_98,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/6e36c1_ca26d0c0d90c4261a955f52870b1808c~mv2.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Beautiful wedding couple beneath fall leaves in a Japanese garden in Nara.', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e36c1_b6e75182ca8049338ea99c924ee0bcea~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_98,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/6e36c1_b6e75182ca8049338ea99c924ee0bcea~mv2.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Eloping couple exchange vows in an ancient tea house in a beautiful Japanese garden in Nara.', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e36c1_b54cf5e5716647d494254c23e2e2e602~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_98,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/6e36c1_b54cf5e5716647d494254c23e2e2e602~mv2.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Wedding couple standing in front of a beautiful Japanese gazebo in Nara Park, Japan.', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e36c1_8b2e0eafda3a486caa86d7ea274f6c2a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_98,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/6e36c1_8b2e0eafda3a486caa86d7ea274f6c2a~mv2.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Eloping couple taking in the sunset amidst the tall grass atop a mountain overlooking Nara at the end of their elopement day.', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://photo-trips.com/where-to-propose-in-japan-best-proposal-spots/', 'content': 'Where To Propose In Japan - 15 Romantic Spots You Should Know Skip to content Sign In Home Tokyo Kyoto Osaka Mt Fuji Seoul Blog About Us Contact Sign In Sign In Home Tokyo Kyoto Osaka Mt Fuji Seoul Blog About Us Contact Sign In List a Property Japan Where To Propose In Japan 15 Romantic Spots You Should Know January 2, 2025 By Photo Trips If youre reading this, then we bet youre well on your way to planning the proposal of a lifetime!

Located about 100 KM (62 miles) from Tokyo, its perfect shape and glorious appearance have made it a pilgrimage site for centuries. To this day, Mt.

The Meoto Iwa site is located in Mie Prefecture in the Kansai Region, and it is truly a sight to behold. There is something so strangely beautiful and indeed, even sacred about two giant boulders at sea, connected together by a thick rope. This rope isnt any ordinary rope, either its shimenawa rope, believed to connect the spiritual and earthly realms together. These Wedded Rocks stand as a gorgeous spectacle and indeed one of the most memorable places you could begin your next chapter in life. The solemnity of the place paired with the stunning view of the rocky site will definitely make for an intimate yet powerful proposal. For that added magical touch, we recommend proposing at sunset! 3. Tokyo Tower Speaking of classics, we cant not mention Tokyo Tower. The countrys most famous and really, iconic skyscraper has borne witness to many proposals done within its premises and for good reason!

About Blog FAQ Get Started Essential Japanese Phrases for Travelers Jan 27 Written By Tomo You\\'re probably not going to master Japanese before your trip.And thats no problem! But you can start! As they say, the best time to start learning Japanese was 10 years ago; the next best time is right now. After all, when it comes to learning the language of the country to which youre traveling, a little bit really does go a long way in Japan . In this essential travel Japanese language guide, we focus on what you\\'ll likely use, what you\\'ll probably remember & what will actually help you during your time in Japan. The Truth About Speaking Japanese in Japan First, some myth-busting : you don\\'t really need to speak Japanese to travel successfully in Japan. But if you do speak, even just a little bit, it can help transform your experience in Japan for the better! Its true that cities in Japan have excellent English signage, and many Japanese people understand basic English even if they\\'re hesitant to speak it. That said, knowing a few key phrases shows respect and can smooth your daily interactions. Something else to know: many Japanese people will respond to your carefully practiced Japanese... in English. Don\\'t take this as a rejection of your efforts. It\\'s often their way of making you feel comfortable and practicing their own language skills. Japanese Pronunciation Basics Before we get to the phrases, let\\'s tackle pronunciation . Japanese is, it turns out, pretty straightforward in this way. Vowels are consistent and pure: A = \"ah\" (like in \"father\") I = \"ee\" (like in \"meet\") U = \"oo\" (like in \"food\") E = \"eh\" (like in \"get\") O = \"oh\" (like in \"go\") Consonants are similar to English, with a few exceptions: R is a light tap, somewhere between L and R F is closer to H with rounded lips Double consonants mean you pause briefly between sounds If you want some examples, head to YouTube or your podcast app and search for beginner level Japanese. Phrases You\\'ll Actually Use Every Day The Basic Three You\\'ll use these three Japanese phrases constantly, so get comfortable with them: Sumimasen (soo-mee-mah-sen): \"Excuse me\" This is your Swiss Army knife of Japanese phrases. It means excuse me, sorry, pardon me & thank you. Use it to get attention, apologize for bumping someone or show gratitude for small favors. Arigat gozaimasu (ah-ree-gah-toh goh-zai-mas): \"Thank you\" The formal version of thank you. Don\\'t worry about the casual \"arigat\" - the polite form is always appropriate. Hai (hai): \"Yes\" Simple and essential. Used to show agreement, understanding or acknowledgment. Wait, did we use the word yes and forget to teach no? No, er, well, not exactly in fact, yes, it was intentional. The word no does have a literal translation in Japanese, but its almost better not even to learn it as using the negative response outright can be culturally taboo or a dealbreaker / nonstarter. If youve ever watched or participated in improv, think of no as the death of a scene, and then take that to Japan w', 'images': [], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/japan-life/japanese-language/10-essential-japanese-phrases-to-know-before-your-trip/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://referjapan.com/essential-japanese-phrases/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.mochitokitravel.com/blog/30-essential-japanese-phrases', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

This guide will help you navigate these means of transport respectfully and appropriately. On Trains, Subways, and Shinkansen Silence is Golden: It is important to maintain silence, especially on trains and subways. Avoid loud conversations and keep your phone on silent mode. On Shinkansen, while it is acceptable to converse in a low tone, many passengers prefer a quiet environment, especially in cars marked as \"Silent Cars.\" Prioritize Seats: Give up your seat to the elderly, pregnant women, people with small children, or anyone who appears to need it more than you. Orderly Lines: Board trains, subways, and Shinkansen by forming orderly lines at the platform markers and allow passengers to disembark before entering. No Eating or Drinking: Avoid eating or drinking on urban trains and subways. On the Shinkansen, eating is acceptable, and many travelers take the opportunity to enjoy ekibens (train lunch boxes) during the journey. On Buses Boarding and Exiting: Generally, enter the bus through the rear door and exit through the front door. Pay the driver or the machine when you leave unless otherwise indicated. Tickets and Passes: Have your pass or the necessary fare ready before boarding to facilitate payment. Designated Seats: Respect seats reserved for passengers with special needs. In Taxis Automatic Doors: Do not attempt to open or close the taxi door manually, as they are automatically controlled by the driver. Clear Directions: Provide the address of your destination in Japanese if possible, or show the driver via a map or app. Payment: While many taxis accept credit cards, it is wise to have cash on hand, especially outside major cities. Tipping is not necessary. General Tips Cleanliness: Maintain cleanliness by taking your trash with you when leaving any public transportation. Luggage: Store your luggage compactly, avoiding placing it on seats or in aisles. Use designated luggage spaces when available.

In Japan , the concept of hairyoa profound embodiment of thoughtfulness and considerationserves as a foundation for public interaction, reflecting a culture deeply rooted in mutual respect. This principle encourages individuals to be aware of their surroundings and anticipate the needs and feelings of others in order to cultivate a harmonious environment. However, navigating the many unwritten rules and social cues can be challenging for foreign travelers. As our readers named Japan the best country in the world in this year's Readers' Choice Awards , resident foodie and travel connoisseur Tokyo Halfie offers a snapshot of essential guidelines for your visit to help you avoid any faux pas. 1. Arrive early Punctuality is not just polite in Japanit's expected. Here, being on time means arriving five to 10 minutes early (especially for restaurant bookings), strongly aligning with the culture of reliability and courtesy. While many may not take offense to being a few minutes late back home, tardiness is considered incredibly disrespectful in Japanese societyso be sure to plan your travel route accordingly, and account for any unforeseen delays. 2. Honor silence Embrace the Japanese appreciation for peace and quiet by adopting a softer demeanor in public spaces. Whether dining in a restaurant, traveling on public transport, or enjoying other shared environments, keeping your voice low is paramountthis mindful approach demonstrates consideration for those around you. By keeping conversations discreet and refraining from loud or disruptive behaviors, you help preserve the tranquil atmosphere that is highly cherished here. Heian Jingu Shrine Getty Images 3. Understand mottainai culture The principle of mottainai embodies a deep gratitude for finite resources, underscoring that nothing should be taken for granted. This philosophy encourages individuals to minimize waste in all formswhether its food, time, or effort. Practicing mottainai can manifest in simple actions, such as avoiding over-ordering dishes at a meal. Rather than allowing food to go to waste, this encourages us to savour every bite by recognizing the rich ecosystem from which the ingredients are sourced, honoring the dedication of the producers, and appreciating the artistry behind each dish. 4. Dining etiquette Dining in Japan comes with its own set of rules that reflect respect for the culinary experience. Aside from arriving on time and using inside voices, guests are expected to follow several important protocols. Asking for the chefs permission before taking photos or videos and refraining from placing your phone or camera directly on the counter at upscale restaurants to prevent scratching the delicate surface (you can ask for or bring a placemat for your device), are just a few examples. In addition, speediness is crucial when taking a snapeach dish is at its best condition the moment it's served and deteriorates with time (some chefs may take offense to this).
