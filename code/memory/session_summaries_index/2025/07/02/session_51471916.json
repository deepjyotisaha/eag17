If you are blessed with a long holiday and want to experience a variety of rural ryokan (traditional Japanese-style inn) stays, youll find plenty of inspiration in our Luxury Ryokans & the Japanese Countryside itinerary. But what if youre a bit shorter on time, and only have 1 or 2 nights to spare in between visits to Tokyo and Kyoto? To complement days of exploring Tokyo and strolling the backstreets of Kyoto , there is nothing more relaxing than a short escape into the Japanese countryside. Gora Kadan Luxury Ryokans Near Tokyo and Kyoto Heres the thing: Japan has countless beautiful and authentic ryokans, but not all are convenient for travelers en route from Tokyo to Kyoto (or Osaka ) or vice versa. So we curated this short list of our favorite luxury ryokans, especially for travelers with discerning taste but a limited amount of time. After all, if youre strapped for time, traveling to a remote corner of Japan may not be the best use of your efforts and may leave you with little time or energy to enjoy the destination or the journey! The carefully selected properties below are perfect if you want to stay in one of Japans best ryokans, without too much of a detour from the Tokyo-Kyoto path. Theyre located in a small handful of picturesque areas of Japan including the Izu Peninsula, Hakone National Park, and the lovely Hokuriku region (home to Kanazawa) that are relatively easy to reach and combine well with the Kanto and Kansai regions (where Tokyo and Kyoto are located, respectively). Some are slightly more remote than others, but all are well suited to short stays. Youll have time to kick off your shoes, settle into the gentle pace of the countryside, and spend a peaceful day or two in bliss as you soak it all in. Most importantly, each of these luxurious ryokans offers wonderful Japanese hospitality, soothing onsen (hot springs), and impeccable kaiseki cuisine featuring seasonal and local specialties. So relax, kick back, and enjoy this list of rejuvenating ryokans for your next Japan trip! Yagyu no Sho Luxury Ryokans in the Izu Peninsula The Izu Peninsula (Izu Hanto in Japanese) is a rugged and beautiful area located just a couple of hours southwest of Tokyo, a very easy journey via Japans wonderful rail system . The whole of Izu is blessed with pristine forests, stunning coastlines, and more than its fair share of gorgeous ryokans and onsen. Izu is just slightly more of a detour than Hakone (more on Hakone below), and makes for a perfect rural retreat en route between Tokyo and Kyoto. If you can afford to spend two nights here it is worthwhile, but even with one night you can have a wonderful experience. Plan on about 2 hours from Tokyo by train, and about 3 hours 30 minutes from Kyoto by train and shinkansen (bullet train). Its worth highlighting that, since Izu is less known than Hakone, you can expect a slightly more off-the-beaten-path feel than you would likely find in Hakone. Some of our favorite luxury ryokans in the Izu Peninsula include: Asaba : A historic and luxurious ryokan renowned for its beautiful rooms, soothing onsen, and warm service, located in the hot springs village of Shuzenji Onsen. Yagyu no Sho: Another wonderful luxury ryokan in Shuzenji, boasting wonderful onsen and fantastic kaiseki cuisine. Hanafubuki : While not quite as luxurious as Asaba and Yagyu no Sho above, this is an excellent high-end ryokan with great service and an unparalleled variety of private onsen options. Gora Kadan Luxury Ryokans in Hakone The Hakone region is a well-known national park area full of ryokans and onsen, and on clear days offers stunning views of Mount Fuji.

Peruse our list of the best places to stay in Nara, below. Weve included hostels, hotels, traditional Japanese ryokan, and a couple of wildcard options. Be sure to check out our tips on location, too. Nara is often a tacked-on day trip from Kyoto or Osaka that leaves you little-to-no-time to explore. If you stay a while, though, youll discover that theres much more to this ancient city. Pro tip: If youre torn between privacy and price, check out the Nara hostels with private rooms they can bridge this gap nicely. Some even have private bathrooms. Jump to: Where to stay in Nara Best hostels in Nara Recommended hotels in Nara Best ryokan in Nara Bonus wildcard options Where to stay in Nara There are plenty of hotels, hostels, and ryokan to choose from in Nara not to mention temple stays and even a place with a built-in bakery. Nara is a small city, and the majority of the accommodation is centered between the two train stations and the famous Deer Park. If youre staying longer than one night, however, you may want to explore a little further afield. Check out our guide to things to do in Nara for ideas, and consider checking out the areas historic connection to sake and sushi while youre at it. Many hotels in Nara are close to Tdaiji Temple.|Photo by Gregory Lane The best hostels in Nara Nara is perfect for hostels: its friendly, small enough to explore on the cheap, and has local hosts who want more guests to stay and explore. Choose from the hostel with the built-in bakery (yes, we are mentioning it again), the chance to spend the night in Nara Park itself, and places offering that personal touch. The Deer Park Inn: Sleep in Nara Park From 4,000 (two-night minimum) 30 minutes from Kintetsu Nara Station, 5 minutes from Tdaiji Temple Check availability The dream combination of affordable and peaceful, The Deer Park Inn in Nara has great views, free WiFi, and deer on its doorstep. Located at the foot of Mt. Wakakusa in Nara Park itself, the hostel is set amidst the run of stalls and shops near the temples that make Nara so popular. Its still convenient though, as its just a 30-minute walk from Kintetsu-Nara Station (you can also take a bus or taxi). The only potential catch here is that they have a two-night stay minimum, so youll need to explore Nara for a few days. Rooms and facilities Deer Park Inn has a mix of dorm rooms and private rooms, including family, double, twin, and triple, although all have shared bathrooms. For the dorms, you can choose from six-bed mixed or four-bed female-only. All rooms come with aircon and toiletries. The spacious hangout area looks out onto the park, and while theres no restaurant on site there is a handy kitchen, so you can save some yen and prep your own meals. WiFi is available throughout, and theres a coin laundry too. Hilo Hostel: For the local touch From 3,500 for dorms, 4,500 for private rooms 3 minutes from Nara Station, 30 minutes from Tdaiji Temple and the Deer Park Check availability A homely vibe with a friendly and knowledgeable host, Hilo is the ideal base for exploring Nara on a budget. The hangout area has books and internet.

Its the day trip that goes hand in hand with visiting Osaka and Kyoto , not only because it is one hour away from both areas, but also because its a beautiful getaway from the flashing lights of Osaka and the numerous temples of Kyoto. It still features a little both of both, but the amalgamation of religious shrines and tall mountains in Nara makes it a unique area to explore, whether it be as a quick day trip or slowly over a few days. If youre in it for the long run and want to explore the depths of Nara without having to worry about catching transport back to where you came from, then we highly recommend booking in a ryokan in the area. There are plenty to choose from, and some will even offer the greatest views, most relaxing onsen experiences, and/or memorable kaiseki cuisines you will ever have in Japan. Below weve listed a few of the favourites in Nara, which cover all budgets and all types of travellers. 1.Heijo Are stunning views your cup of tea when traveling? Look no further than Heijo their best asset is most definitely the incredible view of Nara City which stretches far into the horizon. Its one of the most raved on features of this ryokan by past guests, so you can bet you wont be disappointed, especially if youre visiting during special seasons like Cherry Blossom season or Autumn Leaves season. Theres a free shuttle bus that will transport you to and from Nara Station on a 10-minute trip. You wont get bored, as there is a summertime outdoor pool to relax by, LCD TVs in all guestrooms, and public onsens to experience. Dine on an incredible kaiseki dinner made with fresh seasonal ingredients, and wake up to a stunning set breakfast. Why Guests Love It : The hotel is located in the mountain which has fresh air and cherry blossoms. In the morning you can drive 10-minutes to the mountain top where there are wild deer, Sakura, and the view of the whole Nara city which is fantastic!, The location of this hotel is wonderful! Amazing view of Nara and Todaiji. The staff are very nice and helpful, and food is awesome. Do not miss the dinner at the hotel, it will be a perfect experience!. Book It Here : Heijo Ryokan 2.Asukasou This conveniently located ryokan offers customers the options of either sleeping on western-style beds, or on Japanese futons. Quality of rooms, however, remain high regardless of which you pick. Tatami mats are present in both styles of rooms, and wooden furnishings complete the western rooms, whilst shoji sliding doors encapsulate the Japanese vibes of the futon rooms. There is a massage service as well as public baths on-site for your comfort, or else reserve the family bath for complete privacy whilst you indulge in the wonderful Japanese experience. If you reserve the Japanese-style guest rooms, a multi-course kaiseki dinner will be served in the privacy of your room. Why Guests Love It : Everything was absolutely gre', 'images': [{'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryokan-Nara-12-Kasuga-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ryokan Nara #6 – Kasuga Hotel', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-single-2x size-thevoux-single-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kawagoe-Japon-Le-temple-Renkei-ji-couverture.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Kawagoe Japon - Le temple Renkei-ji couverture', 'width': '600', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hakone-Japon-01-Mont-Fuji-Lac-Ashi-Couverture.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Hakone Japon 01 - Mont Fuji Lac Ashi Couverture', 'width': '601', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Akihabara-Tokyo-Japon-Otaku-Anime-Manga.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Akihabara Tokyo Japon Otaku Anime Manga', 'width': '600', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Japan-Countryside-8-135956261.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Japan Countryside 8 - Ryori Ryokan Tsurugata', 'width': '600', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://johnnyafrica.com/perfect-two-week-japan-itinerary/', 'content': 'The Perfect Two Week Japan Itinerary: Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa | Johnny Africa Skip to content No results Home About Blog Latest Posts View All Posts Popular Posts Detailed Travel Itineraries My Travels Where Ive Been View detailed Map 94 countries!

Its a country with immense history, stunning nature, and some of the best food in the world. The contrast between old and new, man made and mother nature, is like nowhere else on Earth. The big cities are modern marvels of technology as Tokyos Shinjuku district makes New Yorks Times Square appear flat. Kinkaku-Ji, or better known as the Golden Temple in Kyoto! A quick high speed train ride away is Kyoto, home to centuries old temples and shrines. Thats where most people finish their trips, which wouldnt be a bad trip by any means. However, the islands of Japan offer a completely different perspective. A third vantage point where the pace of life is much slower and technology has gone on break. Palm trees and tropical beaches dot the landscape and often times, I forget I was ever even in Japan. This itinerary will focus on visiting the highlights of Japan. You cant expect to see too much of the country in just two weeks but this itinerary will hopefully allow you to maximize your trip. Japan is a country I will return to often and by no means will this be the end! Update 2023/2024: Japan is completely reopen for tourism.

Where to propose in Japan? The 15 Best Spots 1. Mt. Fuji Of course, we have to start with the iconic Mt. Fuji. It is part of Japans Three Holy Mountains along with Mount Haku and Mount Tate. But among these three, Mt. Fuji definitely stands out as one of the most iconic symbols of the country. Located about 100 KM (62 miles) from Tokyo, its perfect shape and glorious appearance have made it a pilgrimage site for centuries. To this day, Mt. Fuji stands out as one of the most picturesque places in the country. The best part? On clear days, its quite visible from Tokyo! If you dont want to travel outside of the capital, plenty of Tokyo spots offer beautiful views of the mountain, especially on the citys numerous observation decks. A proposal with Mt. Fuji in the background is as classy and timeless as can be. Who knows? Maybe proposing here will mean your future relationship will be as strong and stable as this great mountain! If you decided to propose in Mt Fuji, we highly recommend you to hire this photographer: Proposal Photographer Mount Fuji . His photos are outstanding as you can see below. For more tips, you can also read our full guide on how to propose in Mount Fuji ! 2. Wedded Rocks (Meoto Iwa) The name itself is already making us hear wedding bells. The Meoto Iwa site is located in Mie Prefecture in the Kansai Region, and it is truly a sight to behold. There is something so strangely beautiful and indeed, even sacred about two giant boulders at sea, connected together by a thick rope. This rope isnt any ordinary rope, either its shimenawa rope, believed to connect the spiritual and earthly realms together. These Wedded Rocks stand as a gorgeous spectacle and indeed one of the most memorable places you could begin your next chapter in life. The solemnity of the place paired with the stunning view of the rocky site will definitely make for an intimate yet powerful proposal. For that added magical touch, we recommend proposing at sunset! 3. Tokyo Tower Speaking of classics, we cant not mention Tokyo Tower. The countrys most famous and really, iconic skyscraper has borne witness to many proposals done within its premises and for good reason! The Tower offers an exhilarating view that will get you and your partners hearts pumping in no time, making for the perfect mome', 'images': [{'url': 'https://photo-trips.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mt-Fuji-Cherry-Blossom-Japan-Proposal-912x1024.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mt-Fuji-Cherry-Blossom-Japan-Proposal', 'width': '749', 'height': '841', 'class': 'size-large wp-image-3347 aligncenter', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://photo-trips.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tokyo-Tower-Japan-Proposal-683x1024.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Tokyo-Tower-Japan-Proposal', 'width': '683', 'height': '1024', 'class': 'size-large wp-image-3349 aligncenter', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://photo-trips.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rikugien-Park-Tokyo-Japan-Proposal-Autumn-683x1024.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Rikugien-Park-Tokyo-Japan-Proposal-Autumn', 'width': '683', 'height': '1024', 'class': 'size-large wp-image-3364 aligncenter', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://photo-trips.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Japan-Couple-Proposal-Wedding-1024x683.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Japan-Couple-Proposal-Wedding', 'width': '749', 'height': '500', 'class': 'size-large wp-image-3346 aligncenter', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://photo-trips.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Meoto-Iwa-Wedded-Rocks-Japan-Proposal-1024x683.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Meoto-Iwa-Wedded-Rocks-Japan-Proposal', 'width': '749', 'height': '500', 'class': 'size-large wp-image-3348 aligncenter', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://shop.japantruly.com/blogs/where-to-go/romantic-places-to-propose-in-japan', 'content': \"15 Most Romantic Places to Propose In Japan Japan Truly Skip to content Shipping Directly from Japan!

You're in for something truly magical. With its blend of breathtaking landscapes, romantic seasonal beauty, and serene cultural spots, Japan is the perfect backdrop for one of lifes biggest moments. As a photographer who has captured countless proposals across Japan, Im sharing some of the most unforgettable places to propose. From cherry blossom parks to quiet lakeside views of Mount Fuji. Lets dive in. Why Japan is perfect for proposals Japan offers four distinct seasons, each with its own charm. Whether you're dreaming of a springtime sakura moment, fiery autumn leaves, or a snow-covered temple in Kyoto, Japan delivers cinematic romance like no other. And with the right planning (and a discreet photographer!), you can have the proposal of your dreams documented forever. Top proposal spots in Japan Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (Tokyo) Lake Kawaguchi (Mount Fuji view) Streets of Tokyo (Asakusa & Shibuya) Osaka Castle (Osaka) 1. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (Tokyo) Best for: Spring cherry blossoms, peaceful garden vibes Why it works: This expansive garden is right in the heart of Tokyo but feels like an escape. In cherry blossom season (late March to early April), its a pastel dream. With its traditional Japanese, English, and French-style gardens, youll have diverse backdrops in one location. Photographer Tip: Early morning is best to beat the crowds and get soft light. Bonus Idea: Propose under a blooming cherry blossom tree, then enjoy a picnic under the petals. 2. Lake Kawaguchi (Mount Fuji view) Best for: Breathtaking Mount Fuji views, lakeside serenity Why it works: On a clear day, Mount Fuji reflects perfectly on the water its one of the most romantic natural backdrops in Japan. You can propose by the lake, along the maple corridor, or even during a scenic boat ride. Photographer Tip: Early morning or late afternoon light makes Fuji pop. Spring and autumn are especially beautiful here. Bonus Idea: Visit during the Fuji Kawaguchiko Autumn Leaves Festival for stunning red foliage and lakeside photo spots. 3. Streets of Tokyo (Asakusa & Shibuya) Best for: Urban charm, vibrant culture, casual romance Why it works: Want something a little more spontaneous or modern? Tokyos neighborhoods like Asakusa offer old-world charm with temples, lantern-lit alleys, and traditional architecture. Shibuya glows with neon lights and buzzing nightlife, ideal for couples who want a playful and untraditional proposal. Photographer Tip: Plan around golden hour or early evening to catch the city lights and dont be afraid to mix tradition with urban cool. Bonus Idea: Propose in a quiet alleyway near Senso-ji Temple, or in front of glowing signs in Kabukicho for a high-energy, unforgettable vibe. 4. Osaka Castle (Osaka) Best for: Historic charm, traditional elegance Why it works: Surrounded by moats, stone walls, and beautiful seasonal gardens, Osaka Castle blends history with fairytale vibes. In spring and autumn, the scenery around the castle is absolutely breathtaking. The Nishinomaru Garden, located inside the castle grounds, is a romantic setting filled with cherry trees and open lawns. Photographer Tip: Late afternoon light brings out the castles golden accents. Sakura season is especially stunning here. Bonus Idea: Propose with the castle in the background, then explore the nearby riverside park for relaxed portraits.

After dreaming of visiting Japan for as long as youve been together, there seems to be no better time or place to finally pop the question. While swept up in the blissful, if somewhat vague vision of your partners starry-eyed nod under the enchanting glow of Tokyo Tower, though, you realize that you have no idea where exactly to create this beautiful memory. Never fear, as we have collected the citys most romantic and non-cheesy spots for you lovebirds. Whether youre getting down on one knee or simply confessing your love to a crush, here are 10 locations to bookmark. Keep in mind that these all work year-round, not just on Valentines Day. List of Contents: Iconic Sights With Fewer Crowds Picturesque Gardens and Parks Other Memorable Spots Related Posts Iconic Sights With Fewer Crowds 1. Shiba Park Known for its stunning views of the iconic Tokyo Tower, Shiba Park is located alongside the peaceful residential neighborhood of Higashi-Azabu. It is completely free to enter, and houses Zojoji, a gorgeous Buddhist temple with strong ties to the Tokugawa clan. While the park is certainly a staple destination for tourists, it rarely feels overwhelmingly crowded, especially on weekdays. If you decide to propose here, make sure to head to the elevated Prince Shiba Park location on Google Maps rather than the street-level Shiba Park location; the former offers a cleaner view of the tower, a rose garden and a more intimate vibe. We recommend getting there right before sunset. Tokyo Tower periodically features special light-ups and color variations, so make sure to check for updates if you would rather experience its classic warm orange tones. Another spot to consider for a Tokyo Tower proposal is Sky Lounge Stellar Garden , the stunning bar at the top of The Prince Park Tower Tokyo, located within Shiba Park. The elegant lounge features an incredible view of the Tokyo skyline, especially after dark. 2. Odaiba Marine Park While there is no shortage of observatories and restaurants boasting beautiful city views, not many rival Odaibas sweeping, cinematic panorama of Tokyos skyline. An artificial island in Tokyo Bay, Odaiba is beloved for its breathtaking view of the Rainbow Bridge, calm atmosphere and glittering city lights. Coupled with a faux Statue of Liberty, Odaibas picturesque sights are somewhat reminiscent of the Manhattan skyline as seen from Brooklyn. Among the several waterfront parks on the island, we recommend Odaiba Marine Park for its ease of access and iconic sights. The promenade that leads to the park is also quite romantic at night, and perfect for strolling hand in hand with your loved one. Despite being a famous sightseeing spot for locals and tourists, the spacious nature of Odaiba ensures privacy and photo opportunities. 3. Tokyo City View in Roppongi Hills Mori Tower If you want to feel like you are in the sky while confessing your love, but dont want to deal with the harsh winds of the Shibuya Sky observation deck, Tokyo City View i', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tokyo-proposal-header-2048x1365.jpg', 'alt_text': 'best tokyo proposal spots', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1365', 'class': 'attachment-large size-large wp-post-image', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shiba-park-2048x1536.jpg', 'alt_text': 'tokyo tower shiba park proposal spots tokyo', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1536', 'class': 'aligncenter wp-image-262151 size-large', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roppongi-mori-tower-2048x1367.jpg', 'alt_text': 'roppongi mori hills observatory', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1367', 'class': 'aligncenter size-large wp-image-262150', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rikugien-2048x1292.jpg', 'alt_text': 'rikugien gardens', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1292', 'class': 'aligncenter size-large wp-image-262149', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shirakawa-gardens-2048x1365.jpg', 'alt_text': 'kiyosumi gardens', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1365', 'class': 'aligncenter wp-image-262153 size-large', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.jrpass.com/blog/marry-me-where-to-propose-in-japan', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://sateur.com/blogs/engagement-ring/where-to-propose-in-japan-9-best-places-itinerary', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://sampleproposal.org/blog/where-to-propose-in-japan', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

If you are blessed with a long holiday and want to experience a variety of rural ryokan (traditional Japanese-style inn) stays, youll find plenty of inspiration in our Luxury Ryokans & the Japanese Countryside itinerary. But what if youre a bit shorter on time, and only have 1 or 2 nights to spare in between visits to Tokyo and Kyoto? To complement days of exploring Tokyo and strolling the backstreets of Kyoto , there is nothing more relaxing than a short escape into the Japanese countryside. Gora Kadan Luxury Ryokans Near Tokyo and Kyoto Heres the thing: Japan has countless beautiful and authentic ryokans, but not all are convenient for travelers en route from Tokyo to Kyoto (or Osaka ) or vice versa. So we curated this short list of our favorite luxury ryokans, especially for travelers with discerning taste but a limited amount of time. After all, if youre strapped for time, traveling to a remote corner of Japan may not be the best use of your efforts and may leave you with little time or energy to enjoy the destination or the journey! The carefully selected properties below are perfect if you want to stay in one of Japans best ryokans, without too much of a detour from the Tokyo-Kyoto path. Theyre located in a small handful of picturesque areas of Japan including the Izu Peninsula, Hakone National Park, and the lovely Hokuriku region (home to Kanazawa) that are relatively easy to reach and combine well with the Kanto and Kansai regions (where Tokyo and Kyoto are located, respectively). Some are slightly more remote than others, but all are well suited to short stays. Youll have time to kick off your shoes, settle into the gentle pace of the countryside, and spend a peaceful day or two in bliss as you soak it all in. Most importantly, each of these luxurious ryokans offers wonderful Japanese hospitality, soothing onsen (hot springs), and impeccable kaiseki cuisine featuring seasonal and local specialties. So relax, kick back, and enjoy this list of rejuvenating ryokans for your next Japan trip! Yagyu no Sho Luxury Ryokans in the Izu Peninsula The Izu Peninsula (Izu Hanto in Japanese) is a rugged and beautiful area located just a couple of hours southwest of Tokyo, a very easy journey via Japans wonderful rail system . The whole of Izu is blessed with pristine forests, stunning coastlines, and more than its fair share of gorgeous ryokans and onsen. Izu is just slightly more of a detour than Hakone (more on Hakone below), and makes for a perfect rural retreat en route between Tokyo and Kyoto. If you can afford to spend two nights here it is worthwhile, but even with one night you can have a wonderful experience. Plan on about 2 hours from Tokyo by train, and about 3 hours 30 minutes from Kyoto by train and shinkansen (bullet train). Its worth highlighting that, since Izu is less known than Hakone, you can expect a slightly more off-the-beaten-path feel than you would likely find in Hakone. Some of our favorite luxury ryokans in the Izu Peninsula include: Asaba : A historic and luxurious ryokan renowned for its beautiful rooms, soothing onsen, and warm service, located in the hot springs village of Shuzenji Onsen. Yagyu no Sho: Another wonderful luxury ryokan in Shuzenji, boasting wonderful onsen and fantastic kaiseki cuisine. Hanafubuki : While not quite as luxurious as Asaba and Yagyu no Sho above, this is an excellent high-end ryokan with great service and an unparalleled variety of private onsen options. Gora Kadan Luxury Ryokans in Hakone The Hakone region is a well-known national park area full of ryokans and onsen, and on clear days offers stunning views of Mount Fuji.

Many hotels in Nara are close to Tdaiji Temple.|Photo by Gregory Lane The best hostels in Nara Nara is perfect for hostels: its friendly, small enough to explore on the cheap, and has local hosts who want more guests to stay and explore. Choose from the hostel with the built-in bakery (yes, we are mentioning it again), the chance to spend the night in Nara Park itself, and places offering that personal touch. The Deer Park Inn: Sleep in Nara Park From 4,000 (two-night minimum) 30 minutes from Kintetsu Nara Station, 5 minutes from Tdaiji Temple Check availability The dream combination of affordable and peaceful, The Deer Park Inn in Nara has great views, free WiFi, and deer on its doorstep. Located at the foot of Mt. Wakakusa in Nara Park itself, the hostel is set amidst the run of stalls and shops near the temples that make Nara so popular. Its still convenient though, as its just a 30-minute walk from Kintetsu-Nara Station (you can also take a bus or taxi). The only potential catch here is that they have a two-night stay minimum, so youll need to explore Nara for a few days.

Its the day trip that goes hand in hand with visiting Osaka and Kyoto , not only because it is one hour away from both areas, but also because its a beautiful getaway from the flashing lights of Osaka and the numerous temples of Kyoto. It still features a little both of both, but the amalgamation of religious shrines and tall mountains in Nara makes it a unique area to explore, whether it be as a quick day trip or slowly over a few days. If youre in it for the long run and want to explore the depths of Nara without having to worry about catching transport back to where you came from, then we highly recommend booking in a ryokan in the area. There are plenty to choose from, and some will even offer the greatest views, most relaxing onsen experiences, and/or memorable kaiseki cuisines you will ever have in Japan. Below weve listed a few of the favourites in Nara, which cover all budgets and all types of travellers. 1.Heijo Are stunning views your cup of tea when traveling? Look no further than Heijo their best asset is most definitely the incredible view of Nara City which stretches far into the horizon. Its one of the most raved on features of this ryokan by past guests, so you can bet you wont be disappointed, especially if youre visiting during special seasons like Cherry Blossom season or Autumn Leaves season. Theres a free shuttle bus that will transport you to and from Nara Station on a 10-minute trip. You wont get bored, as there is a summertime outdoor pool to relax by, LCD TVs in all guestrooms, and public onsens to experience. Dine on an incredible kaiseki dinner made with fresh seasonal ingredients, and wake up to a stunning set breakfast. Why Guests Love It : The hotel is located in the mountain which has fresh air and cherry blossoms. In the morning you can drive 10-minutes to the mountain top where there are wild deer, Sakura, and the view of the whole Nara city which is fantastic!, The location of this hotel is wonderful! Amazing view of Nara and Todaiji. The staff are very nice and helpful, and food is awesome. Do not miss the dinner at the hotel, it will be a perfect experience!. Book It Here : Heijo Ryokan 2.Asukasou This conveniently located ryokan offers customers the options of either sleeping on western-style beds, or on Japanese futons. Quality of rooms, however, remain high regardless of which you pick. Tatami mats are present in both styles of rooms, and wooden furnishings complete the western rooms, whilst shoji sliding doors encapsulate the Japanese vibes of the futon rooms. There is a massage service as well as public baths on-site for your comfort, or else reserve the family bath for complete privacy whilst you indulge in the wonderful Japanese experience. If you reserve the Japanese-style guest rooms, a multi-course kaiseki dinner will be served in the privacy of your room. Why Guests Love It : Everything was absolutely gre', 'images': [{'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryokan-Nara-12-Kasuga-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Ryokan Nara #6 – Kasuga Hotel', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-single-2x size-thevoux-single-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kawagoe-Japon-Le-temple-Renkei-ji-couverture.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Kawagoe Japon - Le temple Renkei-ji couverture', 'width': '600', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hakone-Japon-01-Mont-Fuji-Lac-Ashi-Couverture.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Hakone Japon 01 - Mont Fuji Lac Ashi Couverture', 'width': '601', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Akihabara-Tokyo-Japon-Otaku-Anime-Manga.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Akihabara Tokyo Japon Otaku Anime Manga', 'width': '600', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://asianwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Japan-Countryside-8-135956261.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Japan Countryside 8 - Ryori Ryokan Tsurugata', 'width': '600', 'height': '400', 'class': 'attachment-thevoux-style9-2x size-thevoux-style9-2x thb-lazyload lazyload wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://johnnyafrica.com/perfect-two-week-japan-itinerary/', 'content': 'The Perfect Two Week Japan Itinerary: Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa | Johnny Africa Skip to content No results Home About Blog Latest Posts View All Posts Popular Posts Detailed Travel Itineraries My Travels Where Ive Been View detailed Map 94 countries!

Its a country with immense history, stunning nature, and some of the best food in the world. The contrast between old and new, man made and mother nature, is like nowhere else on Earth. The big cities are modern marvels of technology as Tokyos Shinjuku district makes New Yorks Times Square appear flat. Kinkaku-Ji, or better known as the Golden Temple in Kyoto! A quick high speed train ride away is Kyoto, home to centuries old temples and shrines. Thats where most people finish their trips, which wouldnt be a bad trip by any means. However, the islands of Japan offer a completely different perspective. A third vantage point where the pace of life is much slower and technology has gone on break. Palm trees and tropical beaches dot the landscape and often times, I forget I was ever even in Japan. This itinerary will focus on visiting the highlights of Japan. You cant expect to see too much of the country in just two weeks but this itinerary will hopefully allow you to maximize your trip. Japan is a country I will return to often and by no means will this be the end! Update 2023/2024: Japan is completely reopen for tourism. This is still a great time to visit the country as inflation is low compared to other developed countries and the Yen is at mult', 'images': [{'url': 'https://johnnyafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/golden_temple-wallpaper-1920x1200.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Golden temple kinkaku ji kyoto', 'width': '1024', 'height': '640', 'class': 'wp-image-17606', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://johnnyafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150919_093546.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Kondoi Beach taketomi', 'width': '1024', 'height': '576', 'class': 'wp-image-13043', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://johnnyafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12.jpg', 'alt_text': 'bluefin tuna at tsukiji market in tokyo japan', 'width': '1200', 'height': '842', 'class': 'wp-image-66874', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://johnnyafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-13.jpg', 'alt_text': 'ramen vending machine japan', 'width': '1200', 'height': '800', 'class': 'wp-image-66877', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://johnnyafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-10.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Fuunji ramen tsukemon tokyo japan', 'width': '1024', 'height': '640', 'class': 'wp-image-66866', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://blog.japanwondertravel.com/best-hotels-and-ryokan-in-nara-54056', 'content': '10 Best Hotels and Ryokan in Nara | Japan Wonder Travel Blog Make your trip to Japan wonderful!

Where to propose in Japan? The 15 Best Spots 1. Mt. Fuji Of course, we have to start with the iconic Mt. Fuji. It is part of Japans Three Holy Mountains along with Mount Haku and Mount Tate. But among these three, Mt. Fuji definitely stands out as one of the most iconic symbols of the country. Located about 100 KM (62 miles) from Tokyo, its perfect shape and glorious appearance have made it a pilgrimage site for centuries. To this day, Mt. Fuji stands out as one of the most picturesque places in the country. The best part? On clear days, its quite visible from Tokyo!

The Meoto Iwa site is located in Mie Prefecture in the Kansai Region, and it is truly a sight to behold. There is something so strangely beautiful and indeed, even sacred about two giant boulders at sea, connected together by a thick rope. This rope isnt any ordinary rope, either its shimenawa rope, believed to connect the spiritual and earthly realms together. These Wedded Rocks stand as a gorgeous spectacle and indeed one of the most memorable places you could begin your next chapter in life. The solemnity of the place paired with the stunning view of the rocky site will definitely make for an intimate yet powerful proposal. For that added magical touch, we recommend proposing at sunset! 3. Tokyo Tower Speaking of classics, we cant not mention Tokyo Tower.

You're in for something truly magical. With its blend of breathtaking landscapes, romantic seasonal beauty, and serene cultural spots, Japan is the perfect backdrop for one of lifes biggest moments. As a photographer who has captured countless proposals across Japan, Im sharing some of the most unforgettable places to propose. From cherry blossom parks to quiet lakeside views of Mount Fuji. Lets dive in. Why Japan is perfect for proposals Japan offers four distinct seasons, each with its own charm. Whether you're dreaming of a springtime sakura moment, fiery autumn leaves, or a snow-covered temple in Kyoto, Japan delivers cinematic romance like no other. And with the right planning (and a discreet photographer!), you can have the proposal of your dreams documented forever. Top proposal spots in Japan Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (Tokyo) Lake Kawaguchi (Mount Fuji view) Streets of Tokyo (Asakusa & Shibuya) Osaka Castle (Osaka) 1. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (Tokyo) Best for: Spring cherry blossoms, peaceful garden vibes Why it works: This expansive garden is right in the heart of Tokyo but feels like an escape. In cherry blossom season (late March to early April), its a pastel dream. With its traditional Japanese, English, and French-style gardens, youll have diverse backdrops in one location. Photographer Tip: Early morning is best to beat the crowds and get soft light. Bonus Idea: Propose under a blooming cherry blossom tree, then enjoy a picnic under the petals. 2. Lake Kawaguchi (Mount Fuji view) Best for: Breathtaking Mount Fuji views, lakeside serenity Why it works: On a clear day, Mount Fuji reflects perfectly on the water its one of the most romantic natural backdrops in Japan. You can propose by the lake, along the maple corridor, or even during a scenic boat ride. Photographer Tip: Early morning or late afternoon light makes Fuji pop. Spring and autumn are especially beautiful here. Bonus Idea: Visit during the Fuji Kawaguchiko Autumn Leaves Festival for stunning red foliage and lakeside photo spots. 3. Streets of Tokyo (Asakusa & Shibuya) Best for: Urban charm, vibrant culture, casual romance Why it works: Want something a little more spontaneous or modern? Tokyos neighborhoods like Asakusa offer old-world charm with temples, lantern-lit alleys, and traditional architecture. Shibuya glows with neon lights and buzzing nightlife, ideal for couples who want a playful and untraditional proposal. Photographer Tip: Plan around golden hour or early evening to catch the city lights and dont be afraid to mix tradition with urban cool. Bonus Idea: Propose in a quiet alleyway near Senso-ji Temple, or in front of glowing signs in Kabukicho for a high-energy, unforgettable vibe. 4. Osaka Castle (Osaka) Best for: Historic charm, traditional elegance Why it works: Surrounded by moats, stone walls, and beautiful seasonal gardens, Osaka Castle blends history with fairytale vibes. In spring and autumn, the scenery around the castle is absolutely breathtaking. The Nishinomaru Garden, located inside the castle grounds, is a romantic setting filled with cherry trees and open lawns. Photographer Tip: Late afternoon light brings out the castles golden accents. Sakura season is especially stunning here. Bonus Idea: Propose with the castle in the background, then explore the nearby riverside park for relaxed portraits.

After dreaming of visiting Japan for as long as youve been together, there seems to be no better time or place to finally pop the question. While swept up in the blissful, if somewhat vague vision of your partners starry-eyed nod under the enchanting glow of Tokyo Tower, though, you realize that you have no idea where exactly to create this beautiful memory. Never fear, as we have collected the citys most romantic and non-cheesy spots for you lovebirds. Whether youre getting down on one knee or simply confessing your love to a crush, here are 10 locations to bookmark. Keep in mind that these all work year-round, not just on Valentines Day. List of Contents: Iconic Sights With Fewer Crowds Picturesque Gardens and Parks Other Memorable Spots Related Posts Iconic Sights With Fewer Crowds 1. Shiba Park Known for its stunning views of the iconic Tokyo Tower, Shiba Park is located alongside the peaceful residential neighborhood of Higashi-Azabu. It is completely free to enter, and houses Zojoji, a gorgeous Buddhist temple with strong ties to the Tokugawa clan. While the park is certainly a staple destination for tourists, it rarely feels overwhelmingly crowded, especially on weekdays. If you decide to propose here, make sure to head to the elevated Prince Shiba Park location on Google Maps rather than the street-level Shiba Park location; the former offers a cleaner view of the tower, a rose garden and a more intimate vibe. We recommend getting there right before sunset. Tokyo Tower periodically features special light-ups and color variations, so make sure to check for updates if you would rather experience its classic warm orange tones. Another spot to consider for a Tokyo Tower proposal is Sky Lounge Stellar Garden , the stunning bar at the top of The Prince Park Tower Tokyo, located within Shiba Park. The elegant lounge features an incredible view of the Tokyo skyline, especially after dark. 2. Odaiba Marine Park While there is no shortage of observatories and restaurants boasting beautiful city views, not many rival Odaibas sweeping, cinematic panorama of Tokyos skyline. An artificial island in Tokyo Bay, Odaiba is beloved for its breathtaking view of the Rainbow Bridge, calm atmosphere and glittering city lights. Coupled with a faux Statue of Liberty, Odaibas picturesque sights are somewhat reminiscent of the Manhattan skyline as seen from Brooklyn. Among the several waterfront parks on the island, we recommend Odaiba Marine Park for its ease of access and iconic sights. The promenade that leads to the park is also quite romantic at night, and perfect for strolling hand in hand with your loved one. Despite being a famous sightseeing spot for locals and tourists, the spacious nature of Odaiba ensures privacy and photo opportunities. 3. Tokyo City View in Roppongi Hills Mori Tower If you want to feel like you are in the sky while confessing your love, but dont want to deal with the harsh winds of the Shibuya Sky observation deck, Tokyo City View i', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tokyo-proposal-header-2048x1365.jpg', 'alt_text': 'best tokyo proposal spots', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1365', 'class': 'attachment-large size-large wp-post-image', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shiba-park-2048x1536.jpg', 'alt_text': 'tokyo tower shiba park proposal spots tokyo', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1536', 'class': 'aligncenter wp-image-262151 size-large', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roppongi-mori-tower-2048x1367.jpg', 'alt_text': 'roppongi mori hills observatory', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1367', 'class': 'aligncenter size-large wp-image-262150', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rikugien-2048x1292.jpg', 'alt_text': 'rikugien gardens', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1292', 'class': 'aligncenter size-large wp-image-262149', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shirakawa-gardens-2048x1365.jpg', 'alt_text': 'kiyosumi gardens', 'width': '2048', 'height': '1365', 'class': 'aligncenter wp-image-262153 size-large', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.jrpass.com/blog/marry-me-where-to-propose-in-japan', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://sateur.com/blogs/engagement-ring/where-to-propose-in-japan-9-best-places-itinerary', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://sampleproposal.org/blog/where-to-propose-in-japan', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",
