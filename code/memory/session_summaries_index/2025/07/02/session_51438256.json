Without these data points, it is impossible to identify important figures, growth trends, or contributing sectors. The analysis should typically include year-on-year GDP growth rates, sectoral breakdowns (e.g., agriculture, industry, services), and a discussion of the factors influencing GDP performance. These factors could include government policies, global economic conditions, investment levels, and demographic trends. Ideally, the analysis would also highlight any significant changes or economic events affecting the GDP, such as policy reforms, economic crises, or major infrastructural projects. The report would then delve into the specifics of each sector, assessing their respective contributions to overall GDP growth. For example, it would examine the growth rates of key industries within the industrial sector, the performance of various sub-sectors within the service sector, and the impact of agricultural output on GDP. The analysis would also consider the impact of various economic indicators on the GDP, such as inflation rates, interest rates, exchange rates, and trade balances. Furthermore, it would evaluate the effectiveness of government policies aimed at stimulating economic growth and investment. It would also assess the resilience of the Indian economy to external shocks and identify potential risks to future GDP growth. Finally, the analysis would provide insights into the long-term trends in India's GDP and highlight the opportunities and challenges facing the Indian economy in the years to come. With the absence of relevant data, this comprehensive GDP analysis is impossible.",

The Indian economy and the financial system, on the other hand, strengthened by solid macroeconomic fundamentals and healthy balance sheets of financial institutions, are exhibiting robust growth and greater resilience. Introduction 1.1 Since the December 2023 issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR), the global financial system has shown remarkable resilience, weathering the halting progress in the last mile of disinflation, financial stability risks stirred up by higher for longer stance of monetary policy and bouts of volatility unsettling financial markets on incoming data. As market expectations about the future course of monetary policy re-aligned with policy guidance, financial conditions have stabilised and risks of a hard landing have receded. Nonetheless, financial stability risks remain significant in the context of diverging economic conditions across geographies, stretched asset valuations amidst flux in volatility fear gauges, high levels of global debt and commercial real estate strains. Prolonged geopolitical tensions and potential shocks to logistics and supply chains remain a clear and present threat with spillovers to commodity prices, the ongoing disinflation and eventually to the global economic outlook. 1.2 Against this backdrop, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected 1 global growth to remain steady at 3.2 per cent in 2024 as in 2023, 0.3 percentage points higher than in its October 2023 World Economic Outlook update ( Chart 1.1 a ). The World Bank, on the other hand, projects global growth to be lower at 2.6 per cent in 2024 ( Chart 1.1 b ). 1.3 The goal of bringing inflation down to targets remains the key focus of monetary policy authorities the world over, although headwinds are being encountered from sticky services inflation, elections across half the worlds population, and the recent firming up of commodity prices, besides persisting geopolitical tensions ( Chart 1.2 a and b ). 1.4 In this uncertain international economic and financial environment, the Indian economy is exhibiting resilience and remains the fastest growing major economy. Moreover, Indias contribution to global growth is rising and currently stands at 18.5 per cent in 2023-24 2 . 1.5 Real GDP growth is on a rising trajectory, supported by macroeconomic and financial stability. Inflation is moderating, albeit at an uneven pace, fiscal consolidation is underway and the external sector position is improving in spite of global spillovers. The domestic financial system is well buffered with strong capital and liquidity ratios, declining levels of asset impairment and rising profitability ( Charts 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.5 a, b and c ). 1.6 Indias financial system is bank dominated and, therefore, sound health of the banking system is a sine qua non for preserving financial stability.

The January 2025 edition of the World Banks Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report projects India's economy to grow at a steady rate of 6.7% in both FY26 and FY27, significantly outpacing global and regional peers. At a time when global growth is expected to remain at 2.7 per cent in 2025-26, this remarkable performance underscores Indias resilience and its growing significance in shaping the worlds economic trajectory. The GEP report credits this extraordinary momentum to a thriving services sector and a revitalised manufacturing base, driven by transformative government initiatives. From modernising infrastructure to simplifying taxes, these measures are fuelling domestic growth and positioning India as a cornerstone of global economic stability. With its closest competitor, China, decelerating to 4 per cent growth next year, Indias rise is more than just a statistic. It is a powerful story of ambition, innovation, and unmatched potential. Complementing the World Bank report, the latest update from the International Monetary Funds (IMF) World Economic Outlook (WEO) also reinforces Indias strong economic trajectory. The IMF forecasts India's growth to remain robust at 6.5% for both 2025 and 2026, aligning with earlier projections from October. This consistent growth outlook reflects Indias stable economic fundamentals and its ability to maintain momentum despite global uncertainties. The continued strength of Indias economic performance, as projected by both the World Bank and IMF, underscores the countrys resilience and highlights the sustained strength of its economic fundamentals, making India a crucial player in the global economic landscape. Overview of World Banks GEP Report The Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report is a flagship publication of the World Bank Group that examines trends and projections in the global economy. It places a special emphasis on emerging markets and developing economies, offering insights into their growth trajectories and challenges. Published twice a year in January and June, the report serves as a vital resource for policymakers, economists, and researchers. The January edition delves into detailed analyses of pressing policy issues, while the June edition provides shorter, focused analytical pieces. The latest GEP report marks a significant milestone by offering the first comprehensive review of the performance of developing economies since the beginning of the 21st century. With 2025 signalling the end of its first quarter, the report assesses the progress made by these economies since 2000 and evaluates their future prospects over the next 25 years. This edition features two analytical chapters. One examines the opportunities and challenges faced by middle-income emerging and developing economies, while the other focuses on the progress and hurdles of the worlds poorest nations. Key Findings in January 2025 Report India is projected to remain the fastest-growing large economy for FY26 and FY27, reaffirming its dominance in the global economic landscape. Indias economy is expected to grow at a stable rate of 6.7 per cent annually during FY26 and FY27. Growth in Indias services sector is expected to remain robust, while manufacturing activity will strengthen, supported by government efforts to improve logistics infrastructure and streamline tax systems. Private consumption in India is likely to gain momentum, driven by a stronger labour market, increased access to credit, and lower inflation. Indias Investment growth is expected to remain steady, supported by rising private in\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/photo/2021/aug/ph202183101.png', 'alt_text': 'azadi ka amrit mahotsav', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/socialmedianew/facebook.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Share on facebook', 'width': '40', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/photo/2023/aug/ph2023818240601.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Share on twitter', 'width': '40', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/socialmedianew/whatsapp1.png', 'alt_text': 'Share on whatsapp', 'width': '40', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/socialmedianew/email1.png', 'alt_text': 'Share on email', 'width': '40', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/10/03/india-s-growth-to-remain-resilient-despite-global-challenges', 'content': 'Indias Growth to Remain Resilient Despite Global Challenges Skip to Main Navigation Trending Data Non-communicable     diseases cause 70% of global     deaths Who             We Are What             We Do Where             We Work How             We Work Work             With Us News About the World         Bank Group Organization Partners History Archives Anti                     Racism                     Charter Experts &         Leaders Office                     of the                     President Boards                     of                     Governors Board                     of                     Directors Leadership Experts Accountability Annual                     Report Better Bank Initiative Access                     to                     Information Accountability                     Mechanism World                     Bank                     Group                     Scorecard Data                     Privacy World                     Bank                     Group                     Finances Integrity                     Vice                     Presidency Inspection                     Panel Grievance                     Redress                     Service Independent                     Evaluation                     Group Compliance                     Advisor                     Ombudsman Policies                     &                     Procedures Institutions IBRD IDA IFC MIGA ICSID Development         Projects Projects By                             Country By                             Sector By                             Theme Country                     Engagement Environmental                             &                             Social                             Policies                             for                             Projects Procurement                             for                             Projects                             &                             Programs Results Products &         Services Financing                     Products                     &                     Advisory                     Services Treasury Asset                     Management KNOWLEDGE World                     Bank                     Group                     Academy Research                     &                     Publications Data Learning Development                     Topics Open                     Knowledge                     Repository Trust                     Fund                     Directory Regions Africa East                     Asia and                     Pacific Europe', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/rbi-mpc-meeting-gdp-forecast-indias-central-bank-retains-growth-forecast-6-5/articleshow/121664715.cms', 'content': 'BENCHMARKSLIVE Nifty25,491.60-50.21 FEATURED FUNDS UTI Aggressive Hybrid Fund Regular Plan-Growth 5Y RETURN 22.01 % INVEST NOW FEATURED FUNDS HSBC Large Cap Fund Direct-Growth 5Y RETURN 20.66 % INVEST NOW Enter search text: News English Edition | Today\\'s ePaper My Watchlist Subscribe Sign In Avail Free Trial of ETPrime Exclusive Offer For You! \\t Home ETPrime Markets Market Data AI Masterclass News Industry SME Politics Wealth MF Tech AI Careers Opinion NRI Panache India Web Stories Economy Politics Newsblogs Elections Defence More Business NewsNewsEconomyIndicatorsRBI MPC Meeting GDP Forecast: Indias central bank retains growth forecast at 6.5% RBI MPC Meeting GDP Forecast: Indias central bank retains growth forecast at 6.5% SECTIONS RBI MPC Meeting GDP Forecast: Indias central bank retains growth forecast at 6.5% ET OnlineLast Updated: Jun 06, 2025, 01:00:00 PM IST\\t FOLLOW US SHARE FONT SIZE SAVE PRINT COMMENT Synopsis RBI GDP Growth 2025: India retained its FY2025-26 GDP growth forecast at 6.5% amid global uncertainty. The RBI cut interest rates to 5.50% to spur growth. Despite Q4 GDP rising 7.4%, FY25 saw the slowest growth since COVID. India and the U.S. are finalizing a trade deal, while India is projected to become the worlds fourth-largest economy by 2025. Reuters Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra The Reserve Bank of Indias rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee on Friday retained Indias GDP forecast for FY2025-26 at 6.5% amid economic uncertainty, triggered by shifting trade dynamics around US President Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs. The RBI also retained its quarterly GDP growth projections for FY2025-26 at 6.5% for Q1, 6.7% for Q2, 6.6% for Q3, and 6.3% for Q4 unchanged from its previous estimates.

The uncertainty around the global economic outlook has ebbed somewhat since the MPC met in April in the wake of temporary tariff reprieve and optimism around trade negotiations, said Malhotra. However, \"it continues to remain elevated to weaken sentiments and lower global growth prospects.\"  Trade policy uncertainty continues to weigh on merchandise exports prospects, while the conclusion of free trade agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom and progress with other countries is supportive of trade activity, said Malhotra.

Without these data points, it is impossible to identify important figures, growth trends, or contributing sectors. The analysis should typically include year-on-year GDP growth rates, sectoral breakdowns (e.g., agriculture, industry, services), and a discussion of the factors influencing GDP performance. These factors could include government policies, global economic conditions, investment levels, and demographic trends. Ideally, the analysis would also highlight any significant changes or economic events affecting the GDP, such as policy reforms, economic crises, or major infrastructural projects. The report would then delve into the specifics of each sector, assessing their respective contributions to overall GDP growth. For example, it would examine the growth rates of key industries within the industrial sector, the performance of various sub-sectors within the service sector, and the impact of agricultural output on GDP. The analysis would also consider the impact of various economic indicators on the GDP, such as inflation rates, interest rates, exchange rates, and trade balances. Furthermore, it would evaluate the effectiveness of government policies aimed at stimulating economic growth and investment. It would also assess the resilience of the Indian economy to external shocks and identify potential risks to future GDP growth. Finally, the analysis would provide insights into the long-term trends in India's GDP and highlight the opportunities and challenges facing the Indian economy in the years to come. With the absence of relevant data, this comprehensive GDP analysis is impossible.",

Unfortunately, the absence of underlying data precludes such an analysis in this instance.",

As highlighted in the `gdp_key_points_T002`, the dataset `india_gdp_data_T001` is empty. This absence prevents: \n\n*  Quantifiable analysis of GDP figures\n*  Identification of growth trends over time\n*  Assessment of sectoral contributions (e.g., agriculture, industry, services)\n*  Examination of the impact of economic policies and events",

          "conclusion": "In conclusion, this report serves primarily to acknowledge the limitations imposed by the absence of data. A comprehensive analysis of India's GDP remains contingent on the provision of the necessary data inputs. Until such data is available, any attempt to analyze GDP figures, growth trends, or sector contributions would be speculative and unreliable.",
