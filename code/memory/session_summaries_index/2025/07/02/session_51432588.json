Nagaokakyo was the capital of Japan for a brief period between the Nara period (710-784) and the Heian period (794-1185). Shrines and temples established in that era still exist today. Home to a thriving bamboo culture, Otokuni is often called the home of bamboo, or Take no sato. It also boasts picturesque scenery that gathers crowds of visitors for seasonal cherry blossoms and fall foliage . Well introduce ten wonderful places in Muko, Nagaokakyo, and Oyamazaki , along with tips on the best times to visit. These destinations will make you want to explore the lesser-known side of Kyoto! Muko City Muko is home to the Take-no-Michi Bamboo Road and to the Kyoto Rakusai Bamboo Park , a vast area dedicated to bamboo culture. The historical remains of the Nagaoka Palace that was built here between 784 and 794, as well as Muko Shrine , with a history that goes back to the Nara period, are also located here. The main destinations in Muko City are near Nishi-Muko Station, which can be reached in about 20 minutes using JR and Hankyu line trains from JR Kyoto Station. 1. Take-no-Michi Bamboo Road Take-no-Michi is a 1.8 km (about 1.1 mile) road surrounded by an expansive bamboo grove . Local farmers use this space to cultivate bamboo shoots, an essential ingredient in Japanese cuisine, as well as bamboo for use in handicrafts. Even the intricate, latticed fences are made from bamboo, adding to the scenery. The road is public, so visitors are welcome to enjoy the b', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.kyototourism.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/103.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Yokokuji temple', 'width': '1024', 'height': '682', 'class': 'attachment-large size-large wp-post-image', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.kyototourism.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kyoto-west-1024x640.jpg', 'alt_text': 'A collage of flowers and autumn leaves in Muko City and Nagaokakyo City', 'width': '1024', 'height': '640', 'class': 'wp-image-7990', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.kyototourism.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/18-1024x683.jpg', 'alt_text': 'A close-up shot of bamboo stalks in Kyoto', 'width': '1024', 'height': '683', 'class': 'wp-image-7995', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.kyototourism.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/muko-1024x640.jpg', 'alt_text': 'A collage of temples, bamboo, and art in Muko City, Kyoto', 'width': '1024', 'height': '640', 'class': 'wp-image-8000', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.kyototourism.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/16-1024x683.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Bamboo stalks and bamboo fences lining the Bamboo Path in Kyoto Prefecture', 'width': '1024', 'height': '683', 'class': 'wp-image-8005', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://boutiquejapan.com/kyoto-temples/', 'content': \"A Guide to Kyoto's Best Temples and Shrines Skip to content Boutique Japan Home Trips The Process About Blog Testimonials Contact Search for A Guide to Kyotos Best Temples & Shrines Kyoto is a city that is synonymous with ancient history, deep culture, tranquil temples, and perfectly preserved pagodas. The old imperial capital is home to over 1,600 shrines, temples, and gardens that each serve a special purpose, from bringing success in your studies to matchmaking and even avoiding traffic accidents (yes, really). Of course, some temples are far more famous than others, attracting crowds that number in the thousands, whereas smaller, lesser-known places can offer the opportunity of quiet contemplation whilst admiring sacred architecture as though the very walls were built for your eyes only. Hailing from the UK, but moving to Kyoto to live and work as a travel and lifestyle writer over two years ago, Ive been spoilt with a long list of beautiful places to visit. No matter how long your trip to Kyoto , youll never see it all, but here are what I think are Kyotos most picturesque temples and shrines including magnificent monuments and off-the-beaten-path gems to give you a true taste of a Kyoto, and one that lives up to its reputation. The Famous Ones: Renowned Kyoto Temples & Shrines Kinkaku-ji: the Golden Pavilion Popularly known as the Golden Pavilion, Kinkaku-ji is one of Kyotos most iconic temples. Its beauty is simply incredible and as such, it is always busy, but its most definitely worth fighting the crowds to catch a glimpse of its golden walls glistening in the sun (alternatively, arrive first thing in the morning to be one of the first in). Even with the crowds, I think this is one of the most beautiful places Ive ever visited. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, a National Special Historic Site, and a National Special Landscape, this Zen temple dates to 1397, when the original villa standing on the site was purchased from the Saionji family by shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and transformed into the Kinkaku-ji complex. In 1950, the majority of the building was lost to a fire started by a 22-year-old monk apparently trying to commit suicide. The structure was rebuilt to mimic the original; however, some believe that such an extensive gold-leaf coating was not true to the previous structure even so, it certainly makes for an exceptional view now. Kennin-ji Famous for its wonderful garden and dragon ceiling mural, the grounds of Kennin-ji are a tranquil oasis in the heart of the Gion geisha district. The temple itself can get quite busy, but its nothing compared to some of the more famous spots. Considered to be one of the so-called Kyoto gozan , or five most important Zen temples of Kyoto, it was founded in 1202 and claims to be the oldest Zen temple in Kyoto . Kennin-ji is most famed for its elegant gardens and notable artworks, from the huge Twin Dragons drawing commemorating the 800-year anniversary of its founding, to the pair of gold leaf screens depicting the Japanese gods Raijin (god of lightning, thunder, and storms) and Fujin (god of the wind). Kitano Tenmangu Shrine ( photo by kewpiedollchan CC BY ) Kitano Tenmangu Shrine This shrine is dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane, a politician and scholar who is thought to have been unfairly exiled in times gone by. He was closely associated with Tenjin, the Japanese god of education, so crowds of school children and their families will often gather to pray for luck in exams and success in their studies. Michizane adored plum blossom, so the grounds are awash with 2,000 stunning plum trees that bloom in early spring (read more about spring, and the cherry blossom season ). The maples are also particularly beautiful in their fiery autumn colours . The 25th of every month sees a vast flea market with everything from old scrolls, to bonsai and ceramics, and the temple is a great base to explore Kamishichiken , Kyotos oldest geiko district and an often overlooked area of the city\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://boutiquejapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kinkakuji-Golden-Pavilion-Kyoto-Japan-1140.png', 'alt_text': 'Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion, one of the most renowned Kyoto temples', 'width': '1140', 'height': '760', 'class': 'size-full wp-image-2255', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://boutiquejapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/temples-and-shrines-in-kyoto-.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Kitano Tenmangu Shrine in Kyoto, Japan', 'width': '1024', 'height': '686', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://boutiquejapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Chion-in-temple-in-Kyoto-1140x755.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Grand gateway Chion-in temple in Kyoto', 'width': '968', 'height': '641', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://boutiquejapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Gio-ji-moss-gardens-1140x760.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Beautiful moss gardens outside Gio-ji Temple in Kyoto', 'width': '968', 'height': '645', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://boutiquejapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Goyo-no-matsu-Hosen-in-1140x760.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Hosen-in temple in Kyoto is famed for its iconic pine, goyo no matsu', 'width': '968', 'height': '645', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://enjoy-kyoto.net/articles/general/kyoto-districts/', 'content': 'Kyotos Most Iconic DistrictsEnjoy Kyoto Articles General Artist Food Kyo Person About Us Contact Us Events CLOSE Key Words Traditional Temples Shrines Categories Categories General Artist Food Kyo Person Articles Events CLOSE Enjoy Kyoto Articles General Artist Food Kyo Person About Us Contact Us Events A Guide to Kyotos Most Iconic Districts 06/20/2025 06/20/2025 General General HOME Articles General A Guide to Kyotos Most Iconic Districts Kyoto is a city of many faces. From ancient temples and traditional townhouses to busy shopping streets and quiet mountain villages, each district in the city offers something different. You may be in Kyoto for just a few days, or for a longer stay, but getting to know the character of each area can help you get the most out of your trip. Use this guide to get a sense of some of Kyotos most iconic districts, including what to see and do in each one. Gion and Higashiyama The Heart of Traditional Kyoto If you imagine Kyoto as narrow lanes, lantern-lit teahouses, and the possibility of glimpsing a geisha (or geiko , as theyre known in Kyoto), youre thinking of Gion . This is one of the citys most famous areas and a must-visit for anyone new to Kyoto. In Gion, Hanamikoji Street is the most iconic spot. Walking along this historic road, youll find traditional wooden machiya buildings, many of which serve as private teahouses or upscale kaiseki restaurants. Nearby, the Higashiyama district offers a scenic route to Kiyomizu-dera Temple via the cobbled slopes of Sannenzaka and Ninenzaka. These streets can get pretty popular, though, so be prepared! This area is also home to sights like Yasaka Shrine and Maruyama Park, which is especially busy during cherry blossom season. What to do: Visit Kiyomizu-dera Temple. Watch for maiko (apprentice geisha) in the early evening. Try Kyoto-style sweets or enjoy a full-course kaiseki meal. Arashiyama Nature and Temples on the Citys Edge Located in western Kyoto, Arashiyama is a great place to visit if you want to get a little more nature with your sightseeing: when you arrive at either of Arashiyamas main train stations, youll find yourself near the famous Togetsukyo Bridge, stretching across the Katsura River between forested hills. The area is especially beautiful in the spring and autumn, but worth a visit year-round. Arashiyama is most famous for its Bamboo Grove, an atmospheric path through towering stalks of bamboo. Just be aware that the grove is extremely popular, and its coverage on social media has brought throngs of visitors to come see it, so if you make the trip yourself, you may want to aim for the early morning hours if youre hoping to catch a more tranquil grove visit. Nearby, Tenryu-ji Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, features a beautiful Zen garden and views of the surrounding hills. You can also find some more peaceful walking trails across the Togetsukyo Bridge from the main train stations, or visit the Iwatayama Monkey Park for panoramic views of the city and, of course, a meeting with the charming wild monkeys youll find there. What to do: Walk through the Bamboo Grove early in the morning to avoid crowds Take a boat ride on the Hozugawa River Enjoy yudofu (boiled tofu), a specialty at local restaurants Central Kyoto Imperial Elegance and Historic Landmarks This area includes some of Kyotos most historically significant sites, like the Kyoto Imperial Palace and Nijo Castle . Its also home to more modern conveniences and good public transportation links, making it a strategic base for sightseeing. The Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounds the Imperial Palace and is a pleasant spot for walking. Nearby, Nijo Castle offers a glimpse into shogunate-era architecture and power. Although not as bustling as the downtown area, Central Kyoto is a good blend of culture and convenience. What to do: Tour the Kyoto Imperial Palace grounds. Explore Nijo Castle and its famous nightingale floors. Visit the Nishijin area to see traditional textile wea', 'images': [{'url': 'https://enjoy-kyoto.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pexels-ryutaro-5745776-375x250.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Exploring Daily Life in Kyoto and What it‚Äôs Like As a Local', 'width': '375', 'height': '250', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://enjoy-kyoto.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kaitlyn-baker-vZJdYl5JVXY-unsplash-375x250.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Discover Kyoto‚Äôs Surprising Tech Scene', 'width': '375', 'height': '250', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://enjoy-kyoto.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10138768746_f81575e463_c-375x363.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Guardians of Kyoto: The Dragons of Tenryuji and Beyond', 'width': '375', 'height': '363', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://enjoy-kyoto.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/22237919_m-375x250.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Hunt Down a Deal in Kyoto‚Äôs Best Flea Markets and Shopping Streets', 'width': '375', 'height': '250', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://enjoy-kyoto.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/23567891_m-375x250.jpg', 'alt_text': 'How to Get to Kyoto from Osaka Airports: Kansai International (KIX) and Itami (ITM)', 'width': '375', 'height': '250', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://humbo.com/jp/kyoto', 'content': 'Kyoto - Remarkable temples, shrines, palaces and gardens in the former capital.

Visitors can walk around the pond for different views of the temple, which was originally the retirement villa of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine For those with a keen interest in Shinto traditions, the Fushimi Inari-taisha should be a priority. This shrine is famous for its thousands of vermilion torii gates that create pathway tunnels stretching into the wooded forest of Mount Inari. Walking through these rows of gates is a special experience, leading to various smaller shrines scattered along pathways that offer peaceful observations. Gion District and Cultural Events The Gion District is a window into the living culture of Kyoto.
