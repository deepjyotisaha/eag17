The Mahindra XUV 3XO makes a strong case for itself as a comfortable, trendy value-conscious small SUV but falls short in some areas, earning a B+ grade.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://whatinsider.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.91wheels.com/cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.drivespark.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-driving-impressions-specs-features-images-047267.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Areas Where XUV 3XO Excels**\n\n*   **ADAS Level 2:** The XUV 3XO is one of the few models in its segment to offer ADAS Level 2 features, providing a significant safety advantage.\n*   **Ventilated Seats:** This feature is not commonly found in this segment, offering enhanced comfort.\n* **Standard 6 Airbags:** Offers 6 airbags as standard across all variants.\n\n**6. Areas Where XUV 3XO Falls Short**\n\n*   **Limited Availability of Luxury Features:** Many luxury features are limited to higher-end variants, making them less accessible to budget-conscious buyers.\n*   **Engine Performance:** While the engine options are adequate, some competitors may offer more powerful engines.\n\n**7. Overall Value Proposition**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO offers a compelling value proposition in the sub-4 meter SUV segment. It combines a comprehensive suite of features, a strong emphasis on safety, and a stylish design. While some luxury features are limited to higher-end variants, the XUV 3XO provides a competitive blend of features at its price point. The inclusion of ADAS Level 2 features gives it a distinct advantage over many competitors.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* For customers prioritizing safety, the higher-end variants with ADAS Level 2 are highly recommended.\n* Budget-conscious buyers should consider the base and mid-level variants, which still offer a good balance of features and value.\n* Mahindra should consider making some luxury features more accessible across all variants to enhance the car's appeal to a wider range of customers.\n\n**Risks or Warnings:**\n\n* The performance of ADAS features may vary depending on road conditions and driver behavior. Drivers should always remain attentive and in control of the vehicle.\n* Some aftermarket accessories may not be compatible with the car's electronic systems.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n\n*   Engine Performance\n*   Dimensions and Practicality\n*   Infotainment and Connectivity\n*   Luxury Features\n*   Safety Features\n*   Competitor Analysis\n*   Price and Value Proposition\n*   Variant-Specific Features",

The Mahindra XUV 3XO makes a strong case for itself as a comfortable, trendy value-conscious small SUV but falls short in some areas, earning a B+ grade.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://whatinsider.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.91wheels.com/cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.drivespark.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-driving-impressions-specs-features-images-047267.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

The Mahindra XUV 3XO makes a strong case for itself as a comfortable, trendy value-conscious small SUV but falls short in some areas, earning a B+ grade.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://whatinsider.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.91wheels.com/cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/specifications', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.drivespark.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-driving-impressions-specs-features-images-047267.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Areas Where XUV 3XO Excels**\n\n*   **ADAS Level 2:** The XUV 3XO is one of the few models in its segment to offer ADAS Level 2 features, providing a significant safety advantage.\n*   **Ventilated Seats:** This feature is not commonly found in this segment, offering enhanced comfort.\n* **Standard 6 Airbags:** Offers 6 airbags as standard across all variants.\n\n**6. Areas Where XUV 3XO Falls Short**\n\n*   **Limited Availability of Luxury Features:** Many luxury features are limited to higher-end variants, making them less accessible to budget-conscious buyers.\n*   **Engine Performance:** While the engine options are adequate, some competitors may offer more powerful engines.\n\n**7. Overall Value Proposition**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO offers a compelling value proposition in the sub-4 meter SUV segment. It combines a comprehensive suite of features, a strong emphasis on safety, and a stylish design. While some luxury features are limited to higher-end variants, the XUV 3XO provides a competitive blend of features at its price point. The inclusion of ADAS Level 2 features gives it a distinct advantage over many competitors.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* For customers prioritizing safety, the higher-end variants with ADAS Level 2 are highly recommended.\n* Budget-conscious buyers should consider the base and mid-level variants, which still offer a good balance of features and value.\n* Mahindra should consider making some luxury features more accessible across all variants to enhance the car's appeal to a wider range of customers.\n\n**Risks or Warnings:**\n\n* The performance of ADAS features may vary depending on road conditions and driver behavior. Drivers should always remain attentive and in control of the vehicle.\n* Some aftermarket accessories may not be compatible with the car's electronic systems.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n\n*   Engine Performance\n*   Dimensions and Practicality\n*   Infotainment and Connectivity\n*   Luxury Features\n*   Safety Features\n*   Competitor Analysis\n*   Price and Value Proposition\n*   Variant-Specific Features",
