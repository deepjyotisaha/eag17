February 2025 The Q3 FY25 results of the company reported a year-over-year fall in net profit by more than 20%. Operating margins also narrowed on account of higher input costs and competitive pricing, leading to concerns over future earnings momentum.

Joseph Eapen was elevated to head its global business, a decision to enhance the company's international presence and consolidate expansion plans. April 2025 Increased competition from Aditya Birla's recently introduced brand 'Birla Opus' started affecting Asian Paints' market position. The aggressive pricing policy of the competitor put pressure on the decorative paints segment. May 2025 In Q4 FY25, Asian Paints reported a steep decline in profitalmost 45% lower year-on-yearbecause of soft domestic demand and a one-time loss associated with exiting its Indonesia business.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%.

Infrastructure development initiatives across the region are creating new opportunities for protective coatings and architectural coatings.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products.

The industry's commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by companies like Teknos, which announced its support for research in developing binders and coatings that are 80-100% bio-based in November 2022. The region's robust manufacturing sector continues to drive demand for industrial coatings across various applications. South Korea's prominence in electronics manufacturing, accounting for over 9% of global electronics and computer production in 2021, exemplifies the strong industrial base supporting market growth. The automotive sector has also shown remarkable resilience, with Indonesia's vehicle production surging by 63% to reach 1.13 million units in 2021, creating substantial demand for automotive coatings and refinishing products. Infrastructure development initiatives across the region are creating new opportunities for protective coatings and architectural coatings.
