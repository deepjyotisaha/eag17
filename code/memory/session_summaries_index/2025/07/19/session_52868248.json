Aditya Shastri Lead Trainer & Business Development Head at IIDE Updated on: Jun 30, 2025 About Asian Paints Asian paints were founded in 1942 by four friends -Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani and Arvind Vakil as a partnership firm. The companys beginning predates the freedom of India, and due to the import ban that took hold on the country during World War 2, the company was able to grow in the country without facing any competition at the start. It took them over 25 years to become one of the leading paint manufacturers in India and became a corporate force across Asia, becoming the 3rd largest corporation in the continent in the industry. The company is still majorly owned by 3 out of the 4 original Jain families that started the firm, and a part of Indias legacy business family concerns. Due to their close association with Indias freedom struggle and timing, the company found a large nationalistic appeal with its audiences. Apart from that, it has always been famous for its marketing efforts and iconic advertising. In 1954, R.K. Laxman, the legendary cartoonist, was the creator of Gattu, the mascot of the company and was widely popular. Asian Paints is known to be at the forefront of walking the silver lining between economic appeal and innovation. The first such product that foreshadowed how the company will outpace its competition was their Tractor Emulsion paint, which was a cross between cheap peel off paints and expensive but high-quality plastic paints. Since then, the company has stuck to their success formula and become a behemoth of the industry with an unshakeable position in the market.

YES\n- Have I provided all output file names to coderAgent? What if all coderAgents create files with same names and overwrite them? YES\n- The plan that I will generate will run in Parallel if all dependencies are completed. Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed? YES\n- Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments? NO\n- Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs? YES\n- Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality? YES\n- Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it? It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? YES\n- Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc. YES\n- For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages? Will that not make CoderAgents to work in isolation, each creating its own file/theme/font/css! I should first make a CoderAgent to focus on theme, design, structure, and then send its outputs as inputs to all coderAgents. NO\n- Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task! That's forbidden!!!!",

Yet before we do that, let us first learn a bit more about the company, its history, products, competitors and financial status! Aditya Shastri Lead Trainer & Business Development Head at IIDE Updated on: Jun 30, 2025 About Asian Paints Asian paints were founded in 1942 by four friends -Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani and Arvind Vakil as a partnership firm. The companys beginning predates the freedom of India, and due to the import ban that took hold on the country during World War 2, the company was able to grow in the country without facing any competition at the start. It took them over 25 years to become one of the leading paint manufacturers in India and became a corporate force across Asia, becoming the 3rd largest corporation in the continent in the industry. The company is still majorly owned by 3 out of the 4 original Jain families that started the firm, and a part of Indias legacy business family concerns. Due to their close association with Indias freedom struggle and timing, the company found a large nationalistic appeal with its audiences. Apart from that, it has always been famous for its marketing efforts and iconic advertising. In 1954, R.K. Laxman, the legendary cartoonist, was the creator of Gattu, the mascot of the company and was widely popular. Asian Paints is known to be at the forefront of walking the silver lining between economic appeal and innovation. The first such product that foreshadowed how the company will outpace its competition was their Tractor Emulsion paint, which was a cross between cheap peel off paints and expensive but high-quality plastic paints. Since then, the company has stuck to their success formula and become a behemoth of the industry with an unshakeable position in the market.

Aditya Shastri Lead Trainer & Business Development Head at IIDE Updated on: Jun 30, 2025 About Asian Paints Asian paints were founded in 1942 by four friends -Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani and Arvind Vakil as a partnership firm. The companys beginning predates the freedom of India, and due to the import ban that took hold on the country during World War 2, the company was able to grow in the country without facing any competition at the start. It took them over 25 years to become one of the leading paint manufacturers in India and became a corporate force across Asia, becoming the 3rd largest corporation in the continent in the industry. The company is still majorly owned by 3 out of the 4 original Jain families that started the firm, and a part of Indias legacy business family concerns. Due to their close association with Indias freedom struggle and timing, the company found a large nationalistic appeal with its audiences. Apart from that, it has always been famous for its marketing efforts and iconic advertising. In 1954, R.K. Laxman, the legendary cartoonist, was the creator of Gattu, the mascot of the company and was widely popular. Asian Paints is known to be at the forefront of walking the silver lining between economic appeal and innovation. The first such product that foreshadowed how the company will outpace its competition was their Tractor Emulsion paint, which was a cross between cheap peel off paints and expensive but high-quality plastic paints. Since then, the company has stuck to their success formula and become a behemoth of the industry with an unshakeable position in the market.

There is a strong shift towards eco-friendly, water-based products due to environmental awareness and regulations. June 06, 2025 06:33 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Asia-Pacific Paints & Coating Market, By Country, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities 2020-2030F\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering. The Asia-Pacific Paints & Coating Market was valued at USD 60.15 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 93.40 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 7.45% Market growth is fueled by accelerated urbanization, infrastructure development, and industrial expansion in countries such as China, India, Japan, and across Southeast Asia. Rising construction activities in both residential and commercial segments are significantly increasing the demand for decorative and protective coatings. Furthermore, a growing shift toward eco-friendly, water-based products - driven by environmental awareness, stricter regulations, and the adoption of green building norms - is reshaping product innovation and formulation strategies. Governments in the region are introducing VOC emission regulations, prompting manufacturers to focus on sustainable and high-performance coatings. This regulatory push, combined with smart city initiatives and infrastructure modernization, is driving advancements in product durability, environmental safety, and functional performance, supporting robust growth in the regional paints and coatings industry. Rapid Urbanization and Infrastructure Growth The Asia-Pacific region is undergoing swift urban development, especially in countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, which is significantly boosting demand for paints and coatings across both new construction and refurbishment projects. As of 2024, over 55% of the population resides in urban areas - a figure expected to climb to nearly 65% by 2030. Governments are actively investing in smart city development and infrastructure enhancements, including housing, commercial buildings, bridges, airports, and metro systems. In India, for example, more than 100 smart city projects are progressing, stimulating the need for protective coatings on steel, concrete, and wooden surfaces. Around 20 million new residential units are also being constructed annually, contributing to increased consumption of both interior and exterior coatings. Maintenance activities for public infrastructure, growing at an estimated 10% per year, are also driving recurring demand. Paints and coatings are now essential not only for aesthetic purposes but also for protecting structures against environmental damage. This rising need has prompted manufacturers to scale up production capacities across Southeast Asia, establishing urban and infrastructure growth as a key market driver. Fluctuating Raw Material Prices The volatility in raw material costs remains a major challenge for the Asia-Pacific paints and coatings market. Essential inputs such as titanium dioxide, resins, acrylics, and solvents are subject to frequent price fluctuations driven by crude oil market dynamics, geopolitical instability, and global supply chain constraints. As many countries in the region, including India and Vietnam, rely on imports for these materials, any disruption significantly impacts production costs. Titanium dioxide alone can constitute up to a quarter of the cost in decorative coatings, and its price has seen cons', 'images': [], 'rank': 1}, {'url':

It's important to remember that each step should be atomic and delegate-ready.

YES\n- Have I provided all output file names to coderAgent? What if all coderAgents create files with same names and overwrite them? YES\n- The plan that I will generate will run in Parallel if all dependencies are completed. Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed? YES\n- Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments? NO\n- Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs? YES\n- Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality? YES\n- Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it? It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? YES\n- Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc. YES\n- For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages? Will that not make CoderAgents to work in isolation, each creating its own file/theme/font/css! I should first make a CoderAgent to focus on theme, design, structure, and then send its outputs as inputs to all coderAgents. NO\n- Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task! That's forbidden!!!!",
