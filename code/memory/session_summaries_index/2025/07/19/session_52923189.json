      "agent": "CoderAgent",
      "agent_prompt": "You are tasked with creating a complete Tic Tac Toe game with the following specifications:\n\n*   **Game Logic:** Implement standard Tic Tac Toe rules for two players. Implement the logic to determine the winner or a draw.\n*   **Timer:** Each player has 10 seconds to make a move. If a player fails to make a move within 10 seconds, the other player wins the round. Display timer within the HTML.\n*   **Scorekeeping:** Keep track of each player's score. The first player to reach 3 points wins the entire game.\n*   **Reset Functionality:** Provide a 'Reset Game' button to start a new game, clearing the board and resetting the scores to zero.\n*   **Visuals:** Use attractive color schemes, fonts, and layout. The game board should be visually appealing and easy to interact with. Use CSS to style the elements effectively. Also ensure the board is responsive.\n*   **File Structure:**\n    *   `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the game structure, score display, and buttons.\n    *   `style.css`: CSS file for all styling and layout.\n    *   `script.js`: JavaScript file for game logic, timer, and scorekeeping.\n\n\n**Specific Instructions for Iterative Development (call_self=True):**\n\n*   **Initial Structure:** In the first iteration, focus on creating the basic HTML structure, CSS layout, and JavaScript framework. Include placeholders for key elements and functions that will be completed in subsequent iterations. Use comments like `<!-- PLACEHOLDER FOR BOARD -->`, `// PLACEHOLDER FOR TIMER FUNCTION` etc.\n*   **Subsequent Iterations:** In subsequent calls to self, you will receive your previous code and execution output. Complete the functionalities incrementally based on following tasks:\n    *   Implement the game logic in `script.js`.\n    *   Add the timer functionality using JavaScript. Update the `script.js` accordingly.\n    *   Implement the scorekeeping mechanism in `script.js`. Ensure scores are displayed in `index.html` and updated correctly.\n    *   Add the reset button functionality in `script.js` and `index.html`.\n    *   Apply styling in `style.css` to enhance the visual appeal of the game. Ensure the board is responsive and looks good on different devices.\n    *   Implement first to 3 logic. Update the `script.js` accordingly.\n*   **Output:** Your output should include three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` that contains all the required code.\n*   **DO NOT CALL ANY OTHER AGENTS LIKE FORMATTERAGENT, DISTILLERAGENT, etc. EVER!!**\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Ensure that the `index.html` file includes links to both the `style.css` and `script.js` files.\n*   Use event listeners in JavaScript to handle player moves, timer events, and button clicks.\n*   Handle cases where a player wins or the game ends in a draw.\n*   Use visually distinct styles for each player's moves.\n\n**Initial Theme Suggestions**\n*   **Colors**: Use a dark background with neon or pastel colors for the grid lines and player symbols.\n*   **Fonts**: Choose a modern, easy-to-read font for the score and timer display.\n*   **Layout**: Center the game board on the page with scores displayed above and the reset button below.\n\nMake sure that all the 3 files are stored with proper file name in output's code section. You are allowed to call yourself for upto 10 times, based on your progress. Ensure all files are complete and functional at the end of all iterations. DO NOT call any other agent.",
