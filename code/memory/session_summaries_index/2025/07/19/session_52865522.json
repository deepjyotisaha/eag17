Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,049 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Published July 8, 2025 Views : 1117 3 min read By Yashein Kewalramani Follow us Too confused between AX and MX variants, the new REVX lineup might just be the solution! Quick Highlights Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX range launched from Rs 8.94 lakh (ex-showroom) Sports a body-coloured grille, black wheels, black leatherette seats and REVX badging Makes certain premium features like panoramic sunroof more accessible REVX M variants are positioned between the MX2 and MX2 Pro trims REVX A trims are positioned between the AX5 and AX5 L variants The REVX M comes with the entry-level MPFI engine, while the REVX A gets the TGDi engine Mahindra has just introduced a new range of variants for the XUV 3XO , called the REVX. The REVX range further branches into three variants, called the REVX M, REVX M (O) and REVX A. These variants basically add minor styling tweaks and make the premium top-end features more accessible, giving buyers more value for money. Heres a look at their pricing: Variant Price (ex-showroom) REVX M MPFI Manual Rs 8.94 lakh REVX M (O) MPFI Petrol Manual Rs 9.44 lakh REVX A TGDi Petrol Manual Rs 11.79 lakh REVX A TGDi Petrol Automatic Rs 12.99 lakh REVX M And M (O) The REVX M trim is essentially positioned between the MX2 and MX2 Pro trims, while the M (O) adds a crowd-favourite feature. The REVX version of the XUV 3XO gets REVX badging on the outside, black wheels and a body-coloured grille. The REVX M comes with black leatherette seats, which are otherwise available only with the AX7 variants. You get black wheel covers, a 10.25-inch infotainment, 4 speakers, steering-mounted audio controls, keyless entry, and height-adjustable driver seats. The REVX M (O) further introduces a single-pane sunroof. Both variants can be had only with the entry-level 1.2-litre MPFI engine, which makes 111 PS and 200 Nm, and can be opted for only with a 6-speed manual transmission. It misses out on the diesel option and the convenience of an automatic unit. REVX A The REVX A sits between the AX5 and AX5 L trims. Over the AX5 variant, it gets amenities like a panoramic sunroof, black leatherette seats, dual tone roof, black alloy wheels, auto dimming IRVM and body-coloured grille. It misses out on ADAS, a 360-degree camera, EPB with auto hold and a cooled glove box, which the AX5 L offers. Overall, it provides a different appearance with the black alloy wheels, tweaked grille, and black seats inside. Also, it comes with a panoramic sunroof, making the crowd-favourite feature more accessible. Bad news for diesel buyers, as this variant can only be had with the top-spec turbo-petrol engine. The engine here is a 1.2-litre TGDi petrol unit which makes 130 PS and 230 Nm. The good thing is that it can be had with both a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission. The REVX range can be opted for from 6 dual-tone hues: Tango Red, Nebula Blue, Stealth Black, Everest White and Galaxy Grey. Visually, the REVX range also comes with a body-coloured front grille as well, where the Galaxy Grey gets a Stealth Black grille. ZigSays The REVX range provides buyers with what they want! The demand for black seats, black alloy wheels and a sunroof at a more affordable price was always there, and Mahindra has offered that with the new variants. The only thing that could have been better is that Mahindra could have offered the new variants with more powertrain options, especially the REVX M trims. As for the REVX A, it offers convenience features ove', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/default_avatar_large.png', 'alt_text': 'Add your comment here', 'class': 'nm-proImg', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'class': 'c-p', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'Here’s When The Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 Coupe Will Be Launched In India…', 'title': 'Here’s When The Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 Coupe Will Be Launched In India…', 'class': 'lazy_image', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'MG M9 Set To Be Launched On July 21, Followed By The Cyberster Later This Month…', 'title': 'MG M9 Set To Be Launched On July 21, Followed By The Cyberster Later This Month…', 'class': 'lazy_image', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'Wireless Charging In A Lamborghini EV?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is. NCAP, or the New Car Assessment Program, conducts crash tests to see how well a vehicle can protect its occupants in an accident. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has performed well in its NCAP tests. It was tested under Bharat NCAP (BNCAP), which is Indias version of the global safety program. The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers. All-Wheel Disc Brakes: The XUV 3XO offers disc brakes on all four wheels, providing better braking efficiency. Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kia-Carnival-Price-Specifications-Images-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'used Kia Carnival', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522596 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tata-Harrier-800x800.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier', 'width': '800', 'height': '800', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522339 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kia-Carnival-Price-Specifications-Images-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'used Kia Carnival', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522596 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tata-Harrier-800x800.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier', 'width': '800', 'height': '800', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522339 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times.

The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers. All-Wheel Disc Brakes: The XUV 3XO offers disc brakes on all four wheels, providing better braking efficiency. Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kia-Carnival-Price-Specifications-Images-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'used Kia Carnival', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522596 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tata-Harrier-800x800.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier', 'width': '800', 'height': '800', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522339 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kia-Carnival-Price-Specifications-Images-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'used Kia Carnival', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522596 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tata-Harrier-800x800.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier', 'width': '800', 'height': '800', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522339 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

            "summary": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO prioritizes safety with a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating, 6 airbags, ESC, all-wheel disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS features. These technologies collectively enhance occupant protection and accident prevention.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The Mahindra XUV 3XO has made safety a paramount concern in its design and feature set, positioning itself as a strong contender in the compact SUV segment. A comprehensive analysis reveals a multi-faceted approach to safety, encompassing both passive and active safety systems, along with advanced driver-assistance technologies. The XUV 3XO's commitment to safety is validated by its 5-star safety rating from Bharat NCAP, demonstrating its ability to protect occupants in the event of a collision.\n\n**Passive Safety Features:**\n\nPassive safety features are designed to minimize injury during a crash. The XUV 3XO incorporates several key passive safety elements:\n\n*   **6 Airbags:** The XUV 3XO comes standard with up to 6 airbags, including front, side, and curtain airbags. These airbags provide a cushioning effect during a collision, reducing the risk of head, chest, and pelvic injuries. Airbags are strategically positioned to offer comprehensive protection to all occupants.\n\n    *   **Benefits:** Significantly reduces the severity of injuries in frontal and side-impact collisions. Provides crucial head protection, minimizing the risk of trauma.\n\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Airbags are most effective when used in conjunction with seatbelts. Studies have shown that airbags reduce driver fatalities in frontal crashes by approximately 30%.\n*   **Robust Built and Structural Integrity:** The vehicle's body structure is designed to absorb and distribute impact forces away from the passenger cabin. High-strength steel is used in critical areas to enhance structural rigidity and crashworthiness.\n\n    *   **Benefits:** Maintains the integrity of the passenger compartment during a collision, preventing intrusion and reducing the risk of injury. Provides a stable foundation for the deployment of other safety systems.\n\n    *   **Effectiveness:** A stable bodyshell is essential for achieving high crash test ratings. It ensures that the airbags and seatbelts can function optimally.\n*   **Seatbelt Reminders for All Occupants:** The XUV 3XO includes seatbelt reminders for all seats, prompting occupants to buckle up. This feature helps ensure that all occupants are properly restrained in the event of a crash.\n\n    *   **Benefits:** Increases seatbelt usage, which is the most effective way to prevent serious injuries in a collision.\n\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Seatbelts reduce the risk of fatal injury to front-seat occupants by up to 50% and to rear-seat occupants by up to 25%.\n\n**Active Safety Features:**\n\nActive safety features are designed to prevent accidents from occurring in the first place. The XUV 3XO is equipped with several advanced active safety systems:\n\n*   **Electronic Stability Control (ESC) with Hill Hold Control (HHC):** ESC helps maintain vehicle stability by detecting and reducing skidding. HHC prevents the vehicle from rolling backward on inclines.\n\n    *   **Benefits:** Enhances vehicle control in adverse driving conditions, such as slippery roads or sudden maneuvers. Prevents roll-away accidents on hills.\n\n    *   **Effectiveness:** ESC has been shown to reduce single-vehicle crashes by up to 30%. HHC provides added safety and convenience on steep inclines.\n*   **Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD):** ABS prevents the wheels from locking up during braking, allowing the driver to maintain steering control. EBD distributes braking force optimally between the front and rear wheels.\n\n    *   **Benefits:** Improves braking performance and reduces stopping distances, especially on slippery surfaces. Enhances steering control during emergency braking.\n\n    *   **Effectiveness:** ABS has been shown to reduce the risk of crashes by approximately 10%.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,049 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Published July 8, 2025 Views : 1117 3 min read By Yashein Kewalramani Follow us Too confused between AX and MX variants, the new REVX lineup might just be the solution! Quick Highlights Mahindra XUV 3XO REVX range launched from Rs 8.94 lakh (ex-showroom) Sports a body-coloured grille, black wheels, black leatherette seats and REVX badging Makes certain premium features like panoramic sunroof more accessible REVX M variants are positioned between the MX2 and MX2 Pro trims REVX A trims are positioned between the AX5 and AX5 L variants The REVX M comes with the entry-level MPFI engine, while the REVX A gets the TGDi engine Mahindra has just introduced a new range of variants for the XUV 3XO , called the REVX. The REVX range further branches into three variants, called the REVX M, REVX M (O) and REVX A. These variants basically add minor styling tweaks and make the premium top-end features more accessible, giving buyers more value for money. Heres a look at their pricing: Variant Price (ex-showroom) REVX M MPFI Manual Rs 8.94 lakh REVX M (O) MPFI Petrol Manual Rs 9.44 lakh REVX A TGDi Petrol Manual Rs 11.79 lakh REVX A TGDi Petrol Automatic Rs 12.99 lakh REVX M And M (O) The REVX M trim is essentially positioned between the MX2 and MX2 Pro trims, while the M (O) adds a crowd-favourite feature. The REVX version of the XUV 3XO gets REVX badging on the outside, black wheels and a body-coloured grille. The REVX M comes with black leatherette seats, which are otherwise available only with the AX7 variants. You get black wheel covers, a 10.25-inch infotainment, 4 speakers, steering-mounted audio controls, keyless entry, and height-adjustable driver seats. The REVX M (O) further introduces a single-pane sunroof. Both variants can be had only with the entry-level 1.2-litre MPFI engine, which makes 111 PS and 200 Nm, and can be opted for only with a 6-speed manual transmission. It misses out on the diesel option and the convenience of an automatic unit. REVX A The REVX A sits between the AX5 and AX5 L trims. Over the AX5 variant, it gets amenities like a panoramic sunroof, black leatherette seats, dual tone roof, black alloy wheels, auto dimming IRVM and body-coloured grille. It misses out on ADAS, a 360-degree camera, EPB with auto hold and a cooled glove box, which the AX5 L offers. Overall, it provides a different appearance with the black alloy wheels, tweaked grille, and black seats inside. Also, it comes with a panoramic sunroof, making the crowd-favourite feature more accessible. Bad news for diesel buyers, as this variant can only be had with the top-spec turbo-petrol engine. The engine here is a 1.2-litre TGDi petrol unit which makes 130 PS and 230 Nm. The good thing is that it can be had with both a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission. The REVX range can be opted for from 6 dual-tone hues: Tango Red, Nebula Blue, Stealth Black, Everest White and Galaxy Grey. Visually, the REVX range also comes with a body-coloured front grille as well, where the Galaxy Grey gets a Stealth Black grille. ZigSays The REVX range provides buyers with what they want! The demand for black seats, black alloy wheels and a sunroof at a more affordable price was always there, and Mahindra has offered that with the new variants. The only thing that could have been better is that Mahindra could have offered the new variants with more powertrain options, especially the REVX M trims. As for the REVX A, it offers convenience features ove', 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/default_avatar_large.png', 'alt_text': 'Add your comment here', 'class': 'nm-proImg', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'class': 'c-p', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'Here’s When The Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 Coupe Will Be Launched In India…', 'title': 'Here’s When The Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 Coupe Will Be Launched In India…', 'class': 'lazy_image', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'MG M9 Set To Be Launched On July 21, Followed By The Cyberster Later This Month…', 'title': 'MG M9 Set To Be Launched On July 21, Followed By The Cyberster Later This Month…', 'class': 'lazy_image', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.zigcdn.com/images/spacer.png', 'alt_text': 'Wireless Charging In A Lamborghini EV?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is. NCAP, or the New Car Assessment Program, conducts crash tests to see how well a vehicle can protect its occupants in an accident. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has performed well in its NCAP tests. It was tested under Bharat NCAP (BNCAP), which is Indias version of the global safety program. The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers. All-Wheel Disc Brakes: The XUV 3XO offers disc brakes on all four wheels, providing better braking efficiency. Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kia-Carnival-Price-Specifications-Images-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'used Kia Carnival', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522596 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tata-Harrier-800x800.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier', 'width': '800', 'height': '800', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522339 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kia-Carnival-Price-Specifications-Images-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'used Kia Carnival', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522596 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tata-Harrier-800x800.webp', 'alt_text': 'Tata Harrier', 'width': '800', 'height': '800', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-522339 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.
