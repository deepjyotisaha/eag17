Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products.

Asian Paints, the industry leader for decades, is experiencing a notable decline in market share, while new entrants like Grasim's Birla Opus and JSW are reshaping the competitive landscape. Meanwhile, AkzoNobel is reportedly exploring the sale of its Indian paints business, signaling a potential shift in industry dynamics. Paints & Coating Market in India, Organised Sector Revenue 2023 (INR 56,600) Source: Secondary & Prismane Consulting estimates Market Share Erosion for Asian Paints Asian Paints, which once commanded a robust 60% market share, has seen this decline to 55%. This decrease underscores the impact of intensifying competition, particularly from Grasim Industries' and JSW foray into decorative paints. With a massive investment, entry of Birla Opus and JSW is poised to challenge Asian Paints dominance significantly. Grasim's aggressive strategies include: Presence in 6,000 towns by FY24, backed by a direct dealership model and 50,000 enrolled dealers. Introduction of free tinting machines, loyalty benefits for contractors, and a unique one-year warranty for enamels and wood finishes. A portfolio of 145 products and 1,200 SKUs catering to economy, premium, and luxury segments, alongside waterproofing, wall finishes, and wood coatings. These efforts have resonated strongly with contractors and dealers, many of whom report a marked increase in Grasims on-ground presence and promotional schemes. Pressure on Margins for Paint Majors Asian Paints, Berger Paints, and Kansai Nerolac are responding with countermeasures such as increased trade discounts and consumer offers. However, this price competition threatens to compress margins. With a narrowing profit buffer, the industry leader faces challenges in maintaining profitability amidst growing price wars. AkzoNobel: Possible Exit from Indian Paints Market Since establishing its presence in 1954, AkzoNobel has been a key player in India's paint and coatings market . The company operates with a significant production capacity of over 300 million liters per year, holding around 7% share in India organised paints & coating market. Over the years, the company has been known for its focus on quality and innovation, gaining substantial customer loyalty. The company is reportedly considering divesting its Indian paints business. While the company has a strong portfolio in premium decorative paints and industrial coatings, it has struggled to compete with the increasingly localized and dynamic strategies of Indian players. India Paints & Coating Market Share of Organised Players- (2021-2023) Source: Secondary & Prismane Consulting estimates If AkzoNobel exits, it could pave the way for new investments or consolidation in the market, potentially benefitting competitors like Berger or Grasim, who may seek to acquire assets or market share. Kansai Nerolacs Strategic Moves Kansai Nerolac, a smaller but established player, is taking strategic steps to strengthen its foothold. With new product launches, expansion in waterproofing and allied products, and a focus on industrial paints, the company is diversifying its revenue streams.

By Priya Nair Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin The decorative segment witnessed muted demand during FY25, while business segments such as wood coating and construction chemicals showcased strong growth. The project business also witnessed robust growth trajectory, supported by expansion into new towns and geographies. The Industrial business registered good demand growth, led by the automotive and performance coating businesses. In FY25, the Indian paints industry demonstrated resilience in the face of subdued demand and intensifying competitive pressures. Rural demand remained muted for much of the year, with signs of recovery emerging towards 3Q25. However, the entry of new players into the market further intensified competition, prompting more aggressive pricing strategies. Additionally, an extended monsoon season impacted demand during 2Q25, affecting both retail and project sales. Mgmt. believes that unorganized segment in paints has seen some shrinkage in recent years as organized paint players have expanded into rural areas via distributors and many other means. Key observations: Consolidated revenues stood at Rs 78.2bn (flattish yoy) while EBITDA declined by 8.3%, and PBT before exceptional items decreased by 5.7% yoy. In FY25, company introduced 10 new products within the Paint+ category, contributing to a total of 28 offerings. Companys International subsidiaries in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka faced multiple challenges due to the adverse macroeconomic conditions prevailing in those countries. Revenue and profitability of these subsidiaries were significantly impacted during the year. In Nepal, despite a subdued demand environment, the subsidiary achieved revenue growth and sustained profitability. Companys domestic subsidiary, Nerofix, also faced a challenging market landscape, and focussed efforts are underway to address these headwinds and strengthen performance. During FY25, companys Atchutapuram (Vizag) manufacturing unit commenced commercial production. Companys installed capacity stood at 664mn litres in FY25 vs. 611mn litres in FY24. Capex spending during FY25 stood at Rs 3.5bn vs. Rs 2.4bn in FY24. Capacity projects are in pipeline for finished products as well as intermediates at Jainpur, Sayakha, Hosur, Goindwal Sahib, and Atchutapuram (Vizag) sites. As per mgmt., Indian paints industry is anticipated to experience modest growth in FY26, driven by favourable macroeconomic conditions, rising urbanisation, and increased construction and infrastructure development activities, with decent demand in both decorative and industrial segments. Companys future strategy a) Focus on Paint+, New Products, and Premiumisation, b) Influencer Strategy targeting engagement with architects and interior designers, c) Broaden product range and improve distribution network under new businesses of Construction Chemicals, Wood Finish, and Adhesives, d) Expand geographical reach for project business, e) Provide superior retail experience via expanding shop network. Consolidated cash conversion cycle improved to 90 days of sales in FY25 vs 92 in FY24. Consolidated OCF stood at Rs 6.7bn in FY25 vs. Rs 9bn in FY24. This was on account of unfavourable changes in W.C., incl. increase in trade & other receivables and a lower increase in trade payables/other financial liabilities/provisions in FY25 vs FY24. Consolidated other expenses grew 2% yoy to Rs 13.1bn in FY25 (~17% of sales). 3/5-year CAGR came in at 12%/8%.

By Priya Nair Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin The decorative segment witnessed muted demand during FY25, while business segments such as wood coating and construction chemicals showcased strong growth. The project business also witnessed robust growth trajectory, supported by expansion into new towns and geographies. The Industrial business registered good demand growth, led by the automotive and performance coating businesses. In FY25, the Indian paints industry demonstrated resilience in the face of subdued demand and intensifying competitive pressures. Rural demand remained muted for much of the year, with signs of recovery emerging towards 3Q25. However, the entry of new players into the market further intensified competition, prompting more aggressive pricing strategies. Additionally, an extended monsoon season impacted demand during 2Q25, affecting both retail and project sales. Mgmt. believes that unorganized segment in paints has seen some shrinkage in recent years as organized paint players have expanded into rural areas via distributors and many other means. Key observations: Consolidated revenues stood at Rs 78.2bn (flattish yoy) while EBITDA declined by 8.3%, and PBT before exceptional items decreased by 5.7% yoy. In FY25, company introduced 10 new products within the Paint+ category, contributing to a total of 28 offerings. Companys International subsidiaries in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka faced multiple challenges due to the adverse macroeconomic conditions prevailing in those countries. Revenue and profitability of these subsidiaries were significantly impacted during the year. In Nepal, despite a subdued demand environment, the subsidiary achieved revenue growth and sustained profitability. Companys domestic subsidiary, Nerofix, also faced a challenging market landscape, and focussed efforts are underway to address these headwinds and strengthen performance. During FY25, companys Atchutapuram (Vizag) manufacturing unit commenced commercial production. Companys installed capacity stood at 664mn litres in FY25 vs. 611mn litres in FY24. Capex spending during FY25 stood at Rs 3.5bn vs. Rs 2.4bn in FY24. Capacity projects are in pipeline for finished products as well as intermediates at Jainpur, Sayakha, Hosur, Goindwal Sahib, and Atchutapuram (Vizag) sites. As per mgmt., Indian paints industry is anticipated to experience modest growth in FY26, driven by favourable macroeconomic conditions, rising urbanisation, and increased construction and infrastructure development activities, with decent demand in both decorative and industrial segments. Companys future strategy a) Focus on Paint+, New Products, and Premiumisation, b) Influencer Strategy targeting engagement with architects and interior designers, c) Broaden product range and improve distribution network under new businesses of Construction Chemicals, Wood Finish, and Adhesives, d) Expand geographical reach for project business, e) Provide superior retail experience via expanding shop network. Consolidated cash conversion cycle improved to 90 days of sales in FY25 vs 92 in FY24. Consolidated OCF stood at Rs 6.7bn in FY25 vs. Rs 9bn in FY24. This was on account of unfavourable changes in W.C., incl. increase in trade & other receivables and a lower increase in trade payables/other financial liabilities/provisions in FY25 vs FY24. Consolidated other expenses grew 2% yoy to Rs 13.1bn in FY25 (~17% of sales). 3/5-year CAGR came in at 12%/8%.

Global Paints and Coatings Market Dynamics Drivers: Environmental regulations boosting the demand for VOC-free coatings One of the most significant developments in the coatings industry over the past ten years has been the growing demand for environmentally friendly features. This trend has been largely driven by strict EU regulations pertaining to the reduction of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions throughout the coating life cycle. This has caused a shift in consumer demand from solventborne coatings to more environmentally friendly goods like powdered and aqueous paints and coatings.Federal government agencies and the European Commission develop new legislation and guidelines, like the Eco-product Certifcation Scheme (ECS). These rules guarantee a sustainable and green environment with negligible or no emissions of hazardous volatile organic compounds. Additionally, in 2016, the Quality Council of India (QCl, Pollutom Control Board Authorities) introduced regulations for lead control in houses and paints and coatings.The Government of India (GO1) was strongly advised by the National Referral Centre for Lead Projects in India (NRCLPi) to set the lead content limit for all household and decorative paints at 90 parts per million. These rules incentivize producers of paints and coatings to make investments in bio-based raw materials, resulting in more environmentally friendly finished goods. The adoption of new, low-polluting coating technologies will also be influenced by government restrictions in the US and We', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/paint-coating-market-size.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'title': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/paint-coating-market-bottom-up-approach.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'title': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/paint-coating-market-top-down-approach.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'title': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/assets/images/report24/pop_ban_laptop_1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Market Development & Expansion', 'class': 'img-fluid w-100 mob-width', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.dmca.com/Badges/dmca_protected_sml_120l.png?ID=512a6ded-1d0f-4215-a661-d50c1031e201', 'alt_text': 'DMCA.com Protection Status', 'width': '121px', 'height': '24px', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.reportsanddata.com/report-detail/paints-and-coatings-market', 'content': '[error] Timeout while extracting content', 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandata.com/industry-reports/paints-and-coatings-market', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/paints-and-coatings-market', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.gmiresearch.com/report/paint-and-coatings-market-analysis-industry-research/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

By Priya Nair Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin The decorative segment witnessed muted demand during FY25, while business segments such as wood coating and construction chemicals showcased strong growth. The project business also witnessed robust growth trajectory, supported by expansion into new towns and geographies. The Industrial business registered good demand growth, led by the automotive and performance coating businesses. In FY25, the Indian paints industry demonstrated resilience in the face of subdued demand and intensifying competitive pressures. Rural demand remained muted for much of the year, with signs of recovery emerging towards 3Q25. However, the entry of new players into the market further intensified competition, prompting more aggressive pricing strategies. Additionally, an extended monsoon season impacted demand during 2Q25, affecting both retail and project sales. Mgmt. believes that unorganized segment in paints has seen some shrinkage in recent years as organized paint players have expanded into rural areas via distributors and many other means. Key observations: Consolidated revenues stood at Rs 78.2bn (flattish yoy) while EBITDA declined by 8.3%, and PBT before exceptional items decreased by 5.7% yoy. In FY25, company introduced 10 new products within the Paint+ category, contributing to a total of 28 offerings. Companys International subsidiaries in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka faced multiple challenges due to the adverse macroeconomic conditions prevailing in those countries. Revenue and profitability of these subsidiaries were significantly impacted during the year. In Nepal, despite a subdued demand environment, the subsidiary achieved revenue growth and sustained profitability. Companys domestic subsidiary, Nerofix, also faced a challenging market landscape, and focussed efforts are underway to address these headwinds and strengthen performance. During FY25, companys Atchutapuram (Vizag) manufacturing unit commenced commercial production. Companys installed capacity stood at 664mn litres in FY25 vs. 611mn litres in FY24. Capex spending during FY25 stood at Rs 3.5bn vs. Rs 2.4bn in FY24. Capacity projects are in pipeline for finished products as well as intermediates at Jainpur, Sayakha, Hosur, Goindwal Sahib, and Atchutapuram (Vizag) sites. As per mgmt., Indian paints industry is anticipated to experience modest growth in FY26, driven by favourable macroeconomic conditions, rising urbanisation, and increased construction and infrastructure development activities, with decent demand in both decorative and industrial segments. Companys future strategy a) Focus on Paint+, New Products, and Premiumisation, b) Influencer Strategy targeting engagement with architects and interior designers, c) Broaden product range and improve distribution network under new businesses of Construction Chemicals, Wood Finish, and Adhesives, d) Expand geographical reach for project business, e) Provide superior retail experience via expanding shop network. Consolidated cash conversion cycle improved to 90 days of sales in FY25 vs 92 in FY24. Consolidated OCF stood at Rs 6.7bn in FY25 vs. Rs 9bn in FY24. This was on account of unfavourable changes in W.C., incl. increase in trade & other receivables and a lower increase in trade payables/other financial liabilities/provisions in FY25 vs FY24. Consolidated other expenses grew 2% yoy to Rs 13.1bn in FY25 (~17% of sales). 3/5-year CAGR came in at 12%/8%.

By Priya Nair Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin The decorative segment witnessed muted demand during FY25, while business segments such as wood coating and construction chemicals showcased strong growth. The project business also witnessed robust growth trajectory, supported by expansion into new towns and geographies. The Industrial business registered good demand growth, led by the automotive and performance coating businesses. In FY25, the Indian paints industry demonstrated resilience in the face of subdued demand and intensifying competitive pressures. Rural demand remained muted for much of the year, with signs of recovery emerging towards 3Q25. However, the entry of new players into the market further intensified competition, prompting more aggressive pricing strategies. Additionally, an extended monsoon season impacted demand during 2Q25, affecting both retail and project sales. Mgmt. believes that unorganized segment in paints has seen some shrinkage in recent years as organized paint players have expanded into rural areas via distributors and many other means. Key observations: Consolidated revenues stood at Rs 78.2bn (flattish yoy) while EBITDA declined by 8.3%, and PBT before exceptional items decreased by 5.7% yoy. In FY25, company introduced 10 new products within the Paint+ category, contributing to a total of 28 offerings. Companys International subsidiaries in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka faced multiple challenges due to the adverse macroeconomic conditions prevailing in those countries. Revenue and profitability of these subsidiaries were significantly impacted during the year. In Nepal, despite a subdued demand environment, the subsidiary achieved revenue growth and sustained profitability. Companys domestic subsidiary, Nerofix, also faced a challenging market landscape, and focussed efforts are underway to address these headwinds and strengthen performance. During FY25, companys Atchutapuram (Vizag) manufacturing unit commenced commercial production. Companys installed capacity stood at 664mn litres in FY25 vs. 611mn litres in FY24. Capex spending during FY25 stood at Rs 3.5bn vs. Rs 2.4bn in FY24. Capacity projects are in pipeline for finished products as well as intermediates at Jainpur, Sayakha, Hosur, Goindwal Sahib, and Atchutapuram (Vizag) sites. As per mgmt., Indian paints industry is anticipated to experience modest growth in FY26, driven by favourable macroeconomic conditions, rising urbanisation, and increased construction and infrastructure development activities, with decent demand in both decorative and industrial segments. Companys future strategy a) Focus on Paint+, New Products, and Premiumisation, b) Influencer Strategy targeting engagement with architects and interior designers, c) Broaden product range and improve distribution network under new businesses of Construction Chemicals, Wood Finish, and Adhesives, d) Expand geographical reach for project business, e) Provide superior retail experience via expanding shop network. Consolidated cash conversion cycle improved to 90 days of sales in FY25 vs 92 in FY24. Consolidated OCF stood at Rs 6.7bn in FY25 vs. Rs 9bn in FY24.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products.

Asian Paints, the industry leader for decades, is experiencing a notable decline in market share, while new entrants like Grasim's Birla Opus and JSW are reshaping the competitive landscape. Meanwhile, AkzoNobel is reportedly exploring the sale of its Indian paints business, signaling a potential shift in industry dynamics. Paints & Coating Market in India, Organised Sector Revenue 2023 (INR 56,600) Source: Secondary & Prismane Consulting estimates Market Share Erosion for Asian Paints Asian Paints, which once commanded a robust 60% market share, has seen this decline to 55%. This decrease underscores the impact of intensifying competition, particularly from Grasim Industries' and JSW foray into decorative paints. With a massive investment, entry of Birla Opus and JSW is poised to challenge Asian Paints dominance significantly. Grasim's aggressive strategies include: Presence in 6,000 towns by FY24, backed by a direct dealership model and 50,000 enrolled dealers. Introduction of free tinting machines, loyalty benefits for contractors, and a unique one-year warranty for enamels and wood finishes. A portfolio of 145 products and 1,200 SKUs catering to economy, premium, and luxury segments, alongside waterproofing, wall finishes, and wood coatings. These efforts have resonated strongly with contractors and dealers, many of whom report a marked increase in Grasims on-ground presence and promotional schemes. Pressure on Margins for Paint Majors Asian Paints, Berger Paints, and Kansai Nerolac are responding with countermeasures such as increased trade discounts and consumer offers. However, this price competition threatens to compress margins. With a narrowing profit buffer, the industry leader faces challenges in maintaining profitability amidst growing price wars. AkzoNobel: Possible Exit from Indian Paints Market Since establishing its presence in 1954, AkzoNobel has been a key player in India's paint and coatings market . The company operates with a significant production capacity of over 300 million liters per year, holding around 7% share in India organised paints & coating market. Over the years, the company has been known for its focus on quality and innovation, gaining substantial customer loyalty. The company is reportedly considering divesting its Indian paints business. While the company has a strong portfolio in premium decorative paints and industrial coatings, it has struggled to compete with the increasingly localized and dynamic strategies of Indian players. India Paints & Coating Market Share of Organised Players- (2021-2023) Source: Secondary & Prismane Consulting estimates If AkzoNobel exits, it could pave the way for new investments or consolidation in the market, potentially benefitting competitors like Berger or Grasim, who may seek to acquire assets or market share. Kansai Nerolacs Strategic Moves Kansai Nerolac, a smaller but established player, is taking strategic steps to strengthen its foothold. With new product launches, expansion in waterproofing and allied products, and a focus on industrial paints, the company is diversifying its revenue streams.

By Priya Nair Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin The decorative segment witnessed muted demand during FY25, while business segments such as wood coating and construction chemicals showcased strong growth. The project business also witnessed robust growth trajectory, supported by expansion into new towns and geographies. The Industrial business registered good demand growth, led by the automotive and performance coating businesses. In FY25, the Indian paints industry demonstrated resilience in the face of subdued demand and intensifying competitive pressures. Rural demand remained muted for much of the year, with signs of recovery emerging towards 3Q25. However, the entry of new players into the market further intensified competition, prompting more aggressive pricing strategies. Additionally, an extended monsoon season impacted demand during 2Q25, affecting both retail and project sales. Mgmt. believes that unorganized segment in paints has seen some shrinkage in recent years as organized paint players have expanded into rural areas via distributors and many other means. Key observations: Consolidated revenues stood at Rs 78.2bn (flattish yoy) while EBITDA declined by 8.3%, and PBT before exceptional items decreased by 5.7% yoy. In FY25, company introduced 10 new products within the Paint+ category, contributing to a total of 28 offerings. Companys International subsidiaries in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka faced multiple challenges due to the adverse macroeconomic conditions prevailing in those countries. Revenue and profitability of these subsidiaries were significantly impacted during the year. In Nepal, despite a subdued demand environment, the subsidiary achieved revenue growth and sustained profitability. Companys domestic subsidiary, Nerofix, also faced a challenging market landscape, and focussed efforts are underway to address these headwinds and strengthen performance. During FY25, companys Atchutapuram (Vizag) manufacturing unit commenced commercial production. Companys installed capacity stood at 664mn litres in FY25 vs. 611mn litres in FY24. Capex spending during FY25 stood at Rs 3.5bn vs. Rs 2.4bn in FY24. Capacity projects are in pipeline for finished products as well as intermediates at Jainpur, Sayakha, Hosur, Goindwal Sahib, and Atchutapuram (Vizag) sites. As per mgmt., Indian paints industry is anticipated to experience modest growth in FY26, driven by favourable macroeconomic conditions, rising urbanisation, and increased construction and infrastructure development activities, with decent demand in both decorative and industrial segments. Companys future strategy a) Focus on Paint+, New Products, and Premiumisation, b) Influencer Strategy targeting engagement with architects and interior designers, c) Broaden product range and improve distribution network under new businesses of Construction Chemicals, Wood Finish, and Adhesives, d) Expand geographical reach for project business, e) Provide superior retail experience via expanding shop network. Consolidated cash conversion cycle improved to 90 days of sales in FY25 vs 92 in FY24. Consolidated OCF stood at Rs 6.7bn in FY25 vs. Rs 9bn in FY24. This was on account of unfavourable changes in W.C., incl. increase in trade & other receivables and a lower increase in trade payables/other financial liabilities/provisions in FY25 vs FY24. Consolidated other expenses grew 2% yoy to Rs 13.1bn in FY25 (~17% of sales). 3/5-year CAGR came in at 12%/8%.

Global Paints and Coatings Market Dynamics Drivers: Environmental regulations boosting the demand for VOC-free coatings One of the most significant developments in the coatings industry over the past ten years has been the growing demand for environmentally friendly features. This trend has been largely driven by strict EU regulations pertaining to the reduction of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions throughout the coating life cycle. This has caused a shift in consumer demand from solventborne coatings to more environmentally friendly goods like powdered and aqueous paints and coatings.Federal government agencies and the European Commission develop new legislation and guidelines, like the Eco-product Certifcation Scheme (ECS). These rules guarantee a sustainable and green environment with negligible or no emissions of hazardous volatile organic compounds.

Global Paints and Coatings Market Dynamics Drivers: Environmental regulations boosting the demand for VOC-free coatings One of the most significant developments in the coatings industry over the past ten years has been the growing demand for environmentally friendly features. This trend has been largely driven by strict EU regulations pertaining to the reduction of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions throughout the coating life cycle. This has caused a shift in consumer demand from solventborne coatings to more environmentally friendly goods like powdered and aqueous paints and coatings.Federal government agencies and the European Commission develop new legislation and guidelines, like the Eco-product Certifcation Scheme (ECS). These rules guarantee a sustainable and green environment with negligible or no emissions of hazardous volatile organic compounds. Additionally, in 2016, the Quality Council of India (QCl, Pollutom Control Board Authorities) introduced regulations for lead control in houses and paints and coatings.The Government of India (GO1) was strongly advised by the National Referral Centre for Lead Projects in India (NRCLPi) to set the lead content limit for all household and decorative paints at 90 parts per million. These rules incentivize producers of paints and coatings to make investments in bio-based raw materials, resulting in more environmentally friendly finished goods. The adoption of new, low-polluting coating technologies will also be influenced by government restrictions in the US and We', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/paint-coating-market-size.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'title': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/paint-coating-market-bottom-up-approach.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'title': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/paint-coating-market-top-down-approach.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'title': 'Paints & Coatings Market Size, and Share', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/assets/images/report24/pop_ban_laptop_1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Market Development & Expansion', 'class': 'img-fluid w-100 mob-width', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://images.dmca.com/Badges/dmca_protected_sml_120l.png?ID=512a6ded-1d0f-4215-a661-d50c1031e201', 'alt_text': 'DMCA.com Protection Status', 'width': '121px', 'height': '24px', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.reportsanddata.com/report-detail/paints-and-coatings-market', 'content': '[error] Timeout while extracting content', 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.marketsandata.com/industry-reports/paints-and-coatings-market', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/paints-and-coatings-market', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.gmiresearch.com/report/paint-and-coatings-market-analysis-industry-research/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",
