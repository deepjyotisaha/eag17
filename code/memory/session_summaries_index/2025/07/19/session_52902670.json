Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca. [ 2 ] Here is an in-depth analysis of Asian Paints competitors and alternatives: Table of Contents Toggle 1. Berger Paints 2. Kansai Nerolac Paints 3. AkzoNobel 4. Nippon Paint 5. Shalimar Paints 6. Jotun Paints 7. Snowcem Paints 8. Indigo Paints 9. JSW Paints 10. Sirca Paints India 1. Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023.

The Asia-Pacific paints and coatings industry is experiencing a significant transformation driven by increasing environmental consciousness and regulatory pressures. Major manufacturers are actively developing eco-friendly paint and coating solutions with lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. This shift is particularly evident in countries like South Korea, where the Ministry of Environment has revised the Clean Air Conservation Act's enforcement rules for VOCs, limiting paint VOC content to a maximum of 67%. The industry's commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by companies like Teknos, which announced its support for research in developing binders and coatings that are 80-100% bio-based in November 2022. The region's robust manufacturing sector continues to drive demand for industrial coatings across various applications. South Korea's prominence in electronics manufacturing, accounting for over 9% of global electronics and computer production in 2021, exemplifies the strong industrial base supporting market growth. The automotive sector has also shown remarkable resilience, with Indonesia's vehicle production surging by 63% to reach 1.13 million units in 2021, creating substantial demand for automotive coatings and refinishing products. Infrastructure development initiatives across the region are creating new opportunities for protective coatings and architectural coatings. Thailand's construction sector is projected to grow by 4.1% in 2022, driven by significant expenditure outlined in the government's budget.

Grasim Industries, a key player in the sector, made a significant entry with its premium paint brand, Birla Opus. Known for its high-quality products, Birla Opus has quickly gained traction, eating into the market share of established players like Asian Paints, Berger Paints, and Indigo Paints. Asian Paints, traditionally the leader in the sector, faces increased competition as Birla Opus focuses on innovation, superior finishes, and sustainable solutions. This has positioned it as a strong contender, offering premium offerings at competitive prices. The brands success has accelerated Grasims growth, enabling it to challenge long-standing market leaders and gain significant market share in the highly competitive Indian paint industry. Share Price As of December 05, 2024, the shares of Asian Paints are currently trading at Rs. 2,437.95, down by 0.88% from their previous close of Rs. 2,459, while the shares of Grasim Industries are trading at Rs. 2,692, down by 0.9% from their previous close of Rs. 2,717. Market Analysis As per the market research reports the Indian paint industry is expected to grow by close to 10% CAGR from 2024- 2029. Historically, the growth rate of the paints sector has exhibited a ~2x co-relation to Indias GDP growth (Presently 7%). In the last few years, the paint industry has outpaced the growth rate of the overall industry. Going by the metrics, the following is the current share of different market players. Rising Competition We can find that JSW Group, a well-established brand in the Steel Segment that entered the paint industry 5 years ago in the form of JSW Paints, has made significant gains in the highly guarded paint industry at the cost of small players, however, this hasnt dented the profitability or growth prospects of big giants like Asian Paints and Berger Paints as of now. However, Grasims entry could pose a looming threat in the long run. Challenges for Asian Paints The probable challenge that Asian Paint may face from Grasim Industries(Birla Opus) is their strong dealer network already in place because of their Cement Segment (UltraTech Cement). Secondly, the entry of a big company like Grasim Industries ensures a heavy budget for marketing campaigns and higher commissions to the dealers and distributors. Asian Paints Q2 FY25 Performance Asian Paints reported a sharp 42.4% decline in net profit for Q2 FY25, falling to Rs 694.64 crore compared to the previous year of Rs. 1,232 crore. Net sales were down 5.3% from 8,479 crore, totaling Rs 8,003.02 crore, primarily due to weak demand, exacerbated by extended monsoons and floods in certain regions. Urban centers faced significant stress, while rural performance was relatively better. The company also saw a decline in its decorative paints business volumes, down by 0.5%. Despite these challenges, Asian Paints expanded its retail footprint to over 1,67,000 touchpoints and scaled its Beautiful Homes Painting Services. The company focused on product innovation, with new products contributing 12% to overall revenue. While brownfield expansion projects are complete, its backward integration projects are progressing well. Current Impact of Grasim Industries (Birla Opus) on the Sector As of now, the immediate threat seems to affect the unorganized and smaller tier-2 and tier-3 players as 12 to 15% of the paint industry is still unorganized.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Jotun Paints 7. Snowcem Paints 8. Indigo Paints 9. JSW Paints 10. Sirca Paints India 1. Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products. Berger is the top competitor for Asian Paints.

The Asia-Pacific paints and coatings industry is experiencing a significant transformation driven by increasing environmental consciousness and regulatory pressures. Major manufacturers are actively developing eco-friendly paint and coating solutions with lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. This shift is particularly evident in countries like South Korea, where the Ministry of Environment has revised the Clean Air Conservation Act's enforcement rules for VOCs, limiting paint VOC content to a maximum of 67%. The industry's commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by companies like Teknos, which announced its support for research in developing binders and coatings that are 80-100% bio-based in November 2022. The region's robust manufacturing sector continues to drive demand for industrial coatings across various applications. South Korea's prominence in electronics manufacturing, accounting for over 9% of global electronics and computer production in 2021, exemplifies the strong industrial base supporting market growth. The automotive sector has also shown remarkable resilience, with Indonesia's vehicle production surging by 63% to reach 1.13 million units in 2021, creating substantial demand for automotive coatings and refinishing products. Infrastructure development initiatives across the region are creating new opportunities for protective coatings and architectural coatings. Thailand's construction sector is projected to grow by 4.1% in 2022, driven by significant expenditure outlined in the government's budget.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Candlesticks Book Telegram Screener Stock Compare Nifty Heatmap Superstar Portfolio Portal Youtube Login Heatmap 0 Items Research Reports Advertise Articles News Screener FinGrad US News Select Page Grasim VS Asian Paints: Who will dominate the paint industry? by Trade Brains | Dec 5, 2024 | 10:38 am | News , Trending News The paint industry in India has seen robust growth, driven by urbanization, rising disposable incomes, and increased demand for decorative and industrial coatings. Grasim Industries, a key player in the sector, made a significant entry with its premium paint brand, Birla Opus. Known for its high-quality products, Birla Opus has quickly gained traction, eating into the market share of established players like Asian Paints, Berger Paints, and Indigo Paints. Asian Paints, traditionally the leader in the sector, faces increased competition as Birla Opus focuses on innovation, superior finishes, and sustainable solutions. This has positioned it as a strong contender, offering premium offerings at competitive prices. The brands success has accelerated Grasims growth, enabling it to challenge long-standing market leaders and gain significant market share in the highly competitive Indian paint industry. Share Price As of December 05, 2024, the shares of Asian Paints are currently trading at Rs. 2,437.95, down by 0.88% from their previous close of Rs. 2,459, while the shares of Grasim Industries are trading at Rs. 2,692, down by 0.9% from their previous close of Rs. 2,717. Market Analysis As per the market research reports the Indian paint industry is expected to grow by close to 10% CAGR from 2024- 2029. Historically, the growth rate of the paints sector has exhibited a ~2x co-relation to Indias GDP growth (Presently 7%). In the last few years, the paint industry has outpaced the growth rate of the overall industry. Going by the metrics, the following is the current share of different market players. Rising Competition We can find that JSW Group, a well-established brand in the Steel Segment that entered the paint industry 5 years ago in the form of JSW Paints, has made significant gains in the highly guarded paint industry at the cost of small players, however, this hasnt dented the profitability or growth prospects of big giants like Asian Paints and Berger Paints as of now. However, Grasims entry could pose a looming threat in the long run. Challenges for Asian Paints The probable challenge that Asian Paint may face from Grasim Industries(Birla Opus) is their strong dealer network already in place because of their Cement Segment (UltraTech Cement). Secondly, the entry of a big company like Grasim Industries ensures a heavy budget for marketing campaigns and higher commissions to the dealers and distributors. Asian Paints Q2 FY25 Performance Asian Paints reported a sharp 42.4% decline in net profit for Q2 FY25, falling to Rs 694.64 crore compared to the previous year of Rs. 1,232 crore. Net sales were down 5.3% from 8,479 crore, totaling Rs 8,003.02 crore, primarily due to weak demand, exacerbated by extended monsoons and floods in certain regions. Urban centers faced significant stress, while rural performance was relatively better. The company also saw a decline in its decorative paints business volumes, down by 0.5%. Despite these challenges, Asian Paints expanded its retail footprint to over 1,67,000 touchpoints and scaled its Beautiful Homes Painting Services. The company focused on product innovation, with new products contributing 12% to overall revenue. While brownfield expansion projects are complete, its backward integration projects are progressing well. Current Impact of Grasim Industries (Birla Opus) on the Sector As of now, the immediate threat seems to affect the unorganized and smaller tier-2 and tier-3 players as 12 to 15% of the paint industry is still unorganized.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Jotun Paints 7. Snowcem Paints 8. Indigo Paints 9. JSW Paints 10. Sirca Paints India 1. Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products. Berger is the top competitor for Asian Paints.

The Asia-Pacific paints and coatings industry is experiencing a significant transformation driven by increasing environmental consciousness and regulatory pressures. Major manufacturers are actively developing eco-friendly paint and coating solutions with lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. This shift is particularly evident in countries like South Korea, where the Ministry of Environment has revised the Clean Air Conservation Act's enforcement rules for VOCs, limiting paint VOC content to a maximum of 67%. The industry's commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by companies like Teknos, which announced its support for research in developing binders and coatings that are 80-100% bio-based in November 2022. The region's robust manufacturing sector continues to drive demand for industrial coatings across various applications. South Korea's prominence in electronics manufacturing, accounting for over 9% of global electronics and computer production in 2021, exemplifies the strong industrial base supporting market growth. The automotive sector has also shown remarkable resilience, with Indonesia's vehicle production surging by 63% to reach 1.13 million units in 2021, creating substantial demand for automotive coatings and refinishing products. Infrastructure development initiatives across the region are creating new opportunities for protective coatings and architectural coatings. Thailand's construction sector is projected to grow by 4.1% in 2022, driven by significant expenditure outlined in the government's budget.

Grasim Industries, a key player in the sector, made a significant entry with its premium paint brand, Birla Opus. Known for its high-quality products, Birla Opus has quickly gained traction, eating into the market share of established players like Asian Paints, Berger Paints, and Indigo Paints. Asian Paints, traditionally the leader in the sector, faces increased competition as Birla Opus focuses on innovation, superior finishes, and sustainable solutions. This has positioned it as a strong contender, offering premium offerings at competitive prices. The brands success has accelerated Grasims growth, enabling it to challenge long-standing market leaders and gain significant market share in the highly competitive Indian paint industry. Share Price As of December 05, 2024, the shares of Asian Paints are currently trading at Rs. 2,437.95, down by 0.88% from their previous close of Rs. 2,459, while the shares of Grasim Industries are trading at Rs. 2,692, down by 0.9% from their previous close of Rs. 2,717. Market Analysis As per the market research reports the Indian paint industry is expected to grow by close to 10% CAGR from 2024- 2029. Historically, the growth rate of the paints sector has exhibited a ~2x co-relation to Indias GDP growth (Presently 7%). In the last few years, the paint industry has outpaced the growth rate of the overall industry. Going by the metrics, the following is the current share of different market players. Rising Competition We can find that JSW Group, a well-established brand in the Steel Segment that entered the paint industry 5 years ago in the form of JSW Paints, has made significant gains in the highly guarded paint industry at the cost of small players, however, this hasnt dented the profitability or growth prospects of big giants like Asian Paints and Berger Paints as of now. However, Grasims entry could pose a looming threat in the long run. Challenges for Asian Paints The probable challenge that Asian Paint may face from Grasim Industries(Birla Opus) is their strong dealer network already in place because of their Cement Segment (UltraTech Cement). Secondly, the entry of a big company like Grasim Industries ensures a heavy budget for marketing campaigns and higher commissions to the dealers and distributors. Asian Paints Q2 FY25 Performance Asian Paints reported a sharp 42.4% decline in net profit for Q2 FY25, falling to Rs 694.64 crore compared to the previous year of Rs. 1,232 crore. Net sales were down 5.3% from 8,479 crore, totaling Rs 8,003.02 crore, primarily due to weak demand, exacerbated by extended monsoons and floods in certain regions. Urban centers faced significant stress, while rural performance was relatively better. The company also saw a decline in its decorative paints business volumes, down by 0.5%. Despite these challenges, Asian Paints expanded its retail footprint to over 1,67,000 touchpoints and scaled its Beautiful Homes Painting Services. The company focused on product innovation, with new products contributing 12% to overall revenue. While brownfield expansion projects are complete, its backward integration projects are progressing well. Current Impact of Grasim Industries (Birla Opus) on the Sector As of now, the immediate threat seems to affect the unorganized and smaller tier-2 and tier-3 players as 12 to 15% of the paint industry is still unorganized.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.
