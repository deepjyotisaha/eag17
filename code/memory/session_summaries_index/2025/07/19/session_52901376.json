Founded in 1942, the company was conceived in Mumbai by four friendsChampaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil. The four friends founded this company with the idea of creating a challenge to some foreign makeup giants in the Indian market. With time, the company journeyed from being a tiny partnership at the onset of its move to a corporate giant that now throws approximately INR 354 billion as consolidated turnover. It involved decoration and industrial paints, waterproofing, paints, adhesives, and decorations for homes such as modular kitchens and sanitary ware. Asian Paints operates in nearly 15 countries with 27 manufacturing facilities and serves more than 60 countries through its subsidiaries such as Berger International and SCIB Paints. Asian Paints has established its supremacy in the Indian paint industry since 1967 and has retained its standing by continuous innovations and a strong focus on consumers. So well known it is regarded for its professionalism and swiftness in which it has developed that it is now the second-largest paint company in Asia and the eighth largest in the world. Its promise of quality as well as service to customers has established that trust factor to be a trusted brand in domestic and also international markets About Asian Paints The genesis of Asian Paints can be traced back to 1942 and was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) by four friends: Champaklal H. Choksey, Chimanlal N. Choksi, Suryakant C. Dani, and Arvind R. Vakil. It was a historically unfortunate time for India because it was associated with the Quit India Movement. Since then, there has been a temporary ban on the import of paints, which has provided a great opportunity for the company. Initially named Asian Oil and Paint Company Pvt. Ltd., its activity was maintaining surface coatings and latex for rubber tires. In 1945, the company pioneered the introduction of smaller paint packets to meet local distribution and demand. Asian Paints changed its name to Asian Paints (India) Pvt. Ltd. in 1965 and, in 1973, became a public limited company. And so, over several decades, the company expanded its national boundaries into many international countries with a wide range of subsidiaries and joint ventures. By 1967, Asian Paints had established its presence as the market leader in India's paint industry, and it has since maintained that status without fail. It is now considered the second-largest paint manufacturer in Asia and ranks eighth in the world , with more than 15 countries and 27 worldwide manufacturing facilities. Innovative marketing strategies and a strong consumer focus have contributed significantly to the company's sustained growth and success in this highly competitive paints industry.

New entrants and aggressive pricing are affecting sales and margins. Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac, and Berger Paints have expressed concerns. Urban demand slowed, but rural demand showed resilience. The industry anticipates modest growth in FY26. ETMarkets.com Indias decorative paints industry is grappling with intensified competition as new players enter the fray with aggressive pricing and discounting strategies. This growing pressure has squeezed profit margins and impacted sales realisation for leading firms, even as overall market growth remained subdued in FY25. Industry leader Asian Paints, which controls over half of the domestic market, flagged the dual challenges of weaker urban demand and competitive pressures from both new and established brands.

These dynamics affected the value realisations as well as the profitability for Asian Paints throughout the year, said Vice-Chairman Manish Choksi at the companys annual general meeting, according to a filing submitted to stock exchanges.  He also noted that weak consumption trends and subdued discretionary spending extended repainting cycles and home maintenance schedules, leading to a drop in demand for architectural paints. Consumers were also moving towards more affordable options, even within the premium segments of decorative paint products across categories, Choksi added. Despite a 2.5% rise in volumes, Asian Paints reported a 5.7% decline in the value of its decorative paints business in FY25, reflecting the pricing pressure and downtrading trend.  Rural demand remained relatively stable, but it wasnt enough to offset the decline in urban markets. The overall weak consumption trends prevalent through FY25 had a dampening impact on the domestic decorative paints market, particularly the urban markets, said Choksi. Other major players echoed similar concerns. Kansai Nerolac Paints, in its annual report, said that the industry showed resilience despite subdued demand and intensifying competitive pressures. Rural demand stayed muted for much of the year, showing some improvement\", 'images': [], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.forbesindia.com/article/take-one-big-story-of-the-day/how-established-paint-companies-are-tackling-hot-competition-from-newer-rivals/76899/1', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://fiveknowledge.com/asian-paints-competitors/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://cultinvestor.com/competitors-of-berger-paints/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Global Top 10 and PCI 25 The 2025 Global Top 10: No. 8 Asian Paints Limited July 10, 2025 8. Asian Paints Limited Mumbai, India Managing Director/CEO: Amit Syngle www.asianpaints.com 2024 Coatings Sales: Approx. $3.95 billion USD (33,797.4) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 Founded in 1942, Asian Paints is Indias largest paint company and one of the top eight coatings manufacturers globally. Asian Paints and its subsidiaries operate in 14 countries and run 26 paint manufacturing facilities, servicing customers in over 60 markets under the brands Asian Paints, Apco Coatings, Asian Paints Berger, Asian Paints Causeway, SCIB Paints, Taubmans and Kadisco Asian Paints. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, the company reported consolidated coatings sales of 33,797.4 crores, a decline of 4.5% from the prior year. Profit before depreciation, interest, tax and exceptional items dropped 20.8% to 6,006.2 crores, with a PBDIT margin of 17.8%. Net profit after minority interest fell 32.8% to 3,667.2 crores, impacted by exceptional charges including impairments on investments in its White Teak and Causeway Paints businesses and losses in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The domestic Decorative coatings business saw a volume increase of 1.8% but faced a revenue decline amid subdued consumer demand and increased competitive pressure. The Industrial segment performed more robustly, with PPG Asian Paints Pvt. Ltd. (PPGAP) posting 6.0% sales growth to 2,136.5 crores and Asian Paints PPG Pvt. Ltd. (APPPG) increasing 4.1% to 1,193.1 crores. Together, the two ventures generated over 3,300 crores in coatings sales. The International business delivered flat nominal growth at 3,066.4 crores but achieved 8.6% growth in constant currency terms. CEO Amit Syngle acknowledged the weak demand conditions that persisted throughout the year, noting, The demand for decorative coatings was only marginally better in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, and emphasized the companys focus on leveraging our brand strength and driving operational efficiencies to pursue growth amid continued macroeconomic uncertainty. The company does not separately report its Home Dcor business, stating it is primarily engaged in the business of Paints and Home Dcor with no separate reportable segment as per Ind AS 108. In previous listings, PCI excluded Home Dcor revenue (typically around 4% of total sales) from coatings figures, but this year,\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/PCI/2025/Jun/EPS/architectural-apartment-building-ad55365701_900.webp?crop=true&height=257&t=1747768769&width=420', 'alt_text': 'Modern arapartment complex painted in bright colors.', 'title': 'apartment block', 'width': '420', 'height': '257', 'class': 'sponsored-content-widget__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 1.0}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/2025/03/18/shutterstock_900.webp?crop=true&height=257&t=1742329579&width=420', 'alt_text': 'paint sprayer in a workshop', 'title': 'shutterstock_900.jpg', 'width': '420', 'height': '257', 'class': 'sponsored-content-widget__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 1.0}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/PCI/2022/pci1022-Kinaltek-Lead-1170.webp?height=740&t=1666283504&width=auto', 'alt_text': 'pci1022-Kinaltek-Lead-1170.jpg', 'title': 'pci1022-Kinaltek-Lead-1170.jpg', 'width': 'auto', 'height': '740', 'class': 'featured-article-recommendations__articles__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/auto-paints-and-coatings.webp?t=1323722324', 'alt_text': 'auto-paints-and-coatings', 'title': 'auto-paints-and-coatings', 'class': 'related-articles__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/PCI/2024/Jul/global-10/PCI-0724-Global10-3-AkzoNobel.webp?crop=true&height=100&t=1727605665&width=100', 'alt_text': 'No. 3 AkzoNobel', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://pawealth.in/asian-paints-indias-largest-paint-company/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.coatingsworld.com/contents/view_top-companies-report/2021-08-02/9-asian-paints-limited-248318/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://thekarostartup.com/asian-paints-case-study/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Founded in 1942, the company was conceived in Mumbai by four friendsChampaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil. The four friends founded this company with the idea of creating a challenge to some foreign makeup giants in the Indian market. With time, the company journeyed from being a tiny partnership at the onset of its move to a corporate giant that now throws approximately INR 354 billion as consolidated turnover. It involved decoration and industrial paints, waterproofing, paints, adhesives, and decorations for homes such as modular kitchens and sanitary ware. Asian Paints operates in nearly 15 countries with 27 manufacturing facilities and serves more than 60 countries through its subsidiaries such as Berger International and SCIB Paints. Asian Paints has established its supremacy in the Indian paint industry since 1967 and has retained its standing by continuous innovations and a strong focus on consumers. So well known it is regarded for its professionalism and swiftness in which it has developed that it is now the second-largest paint company in Asia and the eighth largest in the world. Its promise of quality as well as service to customers has established that trust factor to be a trusted brand in domestic and also international markets About Asian Paints The genesis of Asian Paints can be traced back to 1942 and was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) by four friends: Champaklal H. Choksey, Chimanlal N. Choksi, Suryakant C. Dani, and Arvind R. Vakil. It was a historically unfortunate time for India because it was associated with the Quit India Movement. Since then, there has been a temporary ban on the import of paints, which has provided a great opportunity for the company. Initially named Asian Oil and Paint Company Pvt. Ltd., its activity was maintaining surface coatings and latex for rubber tires. In 1945, the company pioneered the introduction of smaller paint packets to meet local distribution and demand. Asian Paints changed its name to Asian Paints (India) Pvt. Ltd. in 1965 and, in 1973, became a public limited company. And so, over several decades, the company expanded its national boundaries into many international countries with a wide range of subsidiaries and joint ventures. By 1967, Asian Paints had established its presence as the market leader in India's paint industry, and it has since maintained that status without fail. It is now considered the second-largest paint manufacturer in Asia and ranks eighth in the world , with more than 15 countries and 27 worldwide manufacturing facilities. Innovative marketing strategies and a strong consumer focus have contributed significantly to the company's sustained growth and success in this highly competitive paints industry.

New entrants and aggressive pricing are affecting sales and margins. Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac, and Berger Paints have expressed concerns. Urban demand slowed, but rural demand showed resilience. The industry anticipates modest growth in FY26. ETMarkets.com Indias decorative paints industry is grappling with intensified competition as new players enter the fray with aggressive pricing and discounting strategies. This growing pressure has squeezed profit margins and impacted sales realisation for leading firms, even as overall market growth remained subdued in FY25. Industry leader Asian Paints, which controls over half of the domestic market, flagged the dual challenges of weaker urban demand and competitive pressures from both new and established brands.

These dynamics affected the value realisations as well as the profitability for Asian Paints throughout the year, said Vice-Chairman Manish Choksi at the companys annual general meeting, according to a filing submitted to stock exchanges.  He also noted that weak consumption trends and subdued discretionary spending extended repainting cycles and home maintenance schedules, leading to a drop in demand for architectural paints. Consumers were also moving towards more affordable options, even within the premium segments of decorative paint products across categories, Choksi added. Despite a 2.5% rise in volumes, Asian Paints reported a 5.7% decline in the value of its decorative paints business in FY25, reflecting the pricing pressure and downtrading trend.  Rural demand remained relatively stable, but it wasnt enough to offset the decline in urban markets.

Global Top 10 and PCI 25 The 2025 Global Top 10: No. 8 Asian Paints Limited July 10, 2025 8. Asian Paints Limited Mumbai, India Managing Director/CEO: Amit Syngle www.asianpaints.com 2024 Coatings Sales: Approx. $3.95 billion USD (33,797.4) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 Founded in 1942, Asian Paints is Indias largest paint company and one of the top eight coatings manufacturers globally. Asian Paints and its subsidiaries operate in 14 countries and run 26 paint manufacturing facilities, servicing customers in over 60 markets under the brands Asian Paints, Apco Coatings, Asian Paints Berger, Asian Paints Causeway, SCIB Paints, Taubmans and Kadisco Asian Paints. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, the company reported consolidated coatings sales of 33,797.4 crores, a decline of 4.5% from the prior year. Profit before depreciation, interest, tax and exceptional items dropped 20.8% to 6,006.2 crores, with a PBDIT margin of 17.8%. Net profit after minority interest fell 32.8% to 3,667.2 crores, impacted by exceptional charges including impairments on investments in its White Teak and Causeway Paints businesses and losses in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The domestic Decorative coatings business saw a volume increase of 1.8% but faced a revenue decline amid subdued consumer demand and increased competitive pressure. The Industrial segment performed more robustly, with PPG Asian Paints Pvt. Ltd. (PPGAP) posting 6.0% sales growth to 2,136.5 crores and Asian Paints PPG Pvt. Ltd. (APPPG) increasing 4.1% to 1,193.1 crores. Together, the two ventures generated over 3,300 crores in coatings sales. The International business delivered flat nominal growth at 3,066.4 crores but achieved 8.6% growth in constant currency terms. CEO Amit Syngle acknowledged the weak demand conditions that persisted throughout the year, noting, The demand for decorative coatings was only marginally better in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, and emphasized the companys focus on leveraging our brand strength and driving operational efficiencies to pursue growth amid continued macroeconomic uncertainty. The company does not separately report its Home Dcor business, stating it is primarily engaged in the business of Paints and Home Dcor with no separate reportable segment as per Ind AS 108. In previous listings, PCI excluded Home Dcor revenue (typically around 4% of total sales) from coatings figures, but this year,\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/PCI/2025/Jun/EPS/architectural-apartment-building-ad55365701_900.webp?crop=true&height=257&t=1747768769&width=420', 'alt_text': 'Modern arapartment complex painted in bright colors.', 'title': 'apartment block', 'width': '420', 'height': '257', 'class': 'sponsored-content-widget__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 1.0}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/2025/03/18/shutterstock_900.webp?crop=true&height=257&t=1742329579&width=420', 'alt_text': 'paint sprayer in a workshop', 'title': 'shutterstock_900.jpg', 'width': '420', 'height': '257', 'class': 'sponsored-content-widget__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 1.0}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/PCI/2022/pci1022-Kinaltek-Lead-1170.webp?height=740&t=1666283504&width=auto', 'alt_text': 'pci1022-Kinaltek-Lead-1170.jpg', 'title': 'pci1022-Kinaltek-Lead-1170.jpg', 'width': 'auto', 'height': '740', 'class': 'featured-article-recommendations__articles__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/auto-paints-and-coatings.webp?t=1323722324', 'alt_text': 'auto-paints-and-coatings', 'title': 'auto-paints-and-coatings', 'class': 'related-articles__image-thumb', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.pcimag.com/ext/resources/PCI/2024/Jul/global-10/PCI-0724-Global10-3-AkzoNobel.webp?crop=true&height=100&t=1727605665&width=100', 'alt_text': 'No. 3 AkzoNobel', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://pawealth.in/asian-paints-indias-largest-paint-company/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.coatingsworld.com/contents/view_top-companies-report/2021-08-02/9-asian-paints-limited-248318/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://thekarostartup.com/asian-paints-case-study/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",
