The recovery pointed to traction in Indian economic growth after a period of softening, as lower food and energy prices improved eased benchmark interest rates and spurred investment, while India's low dependence on exports made it robust to global tariff threats. Gross fixed capital formation surged by 9.4% in the period, the most in nearly two years, and private consumption expanded by 6%. In the meantime, the net foreign demand had a positive impact in the GDP growth, with exports rising by 3.9%, while imports slumped by 12.7%. Regarding the full fiscal year of 2025, the Indian GDP expanded by 6.5%, the least in four years. source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India expanded 7.40 percent in the first quarter of 2025 over the same quarter of the previous year.
