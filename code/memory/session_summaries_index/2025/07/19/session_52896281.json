Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Jotun Paints 7. Snowcem Paints 8. Indigo Paints 9. JSW Paints 10. Sirca Paints India 1. Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products. Berger is the top competitor for Asian Paints.

Despite starting with a modest capital, the founders had a clear vision of becoming a leading player in the paint industry. Their entrepreneurial spirit and innovative strategies laid the foundation for what would become one of the most successful paint companies in the world.

This move significantly increased their market share, particularly among rural consumers who could now afford to purchase paint in smaller quantities. In the 1970s, Asian Paints continued its innovative streak by developing computer color matching technology, which allowed for a broader range of colors and more accurate mixing. This technological advancement set them apart from competitors and cemented their position as an industry leader. Commitment to Quality and Sustainability Throughout its history, Asian Paints has maintained a strong commitment to quality. The company invests heavily in research and development to ensure its products meet the highest standards. Their state-of-the-art laboratories and manufacturing facilities are equipped with the latest technology to ensure consistency and excellence in every product. Sustainability is also a core value for Asian Paints. The company has implemented various eco-friendly initiatives, such as water-based paints that reduce environmental impact and energy-efficient manufacturing processes. These efforts have earned Asian Paints numerous accolades for sustainability and corporate responsibility. Global Expansion Asian Paints success is not limited to India.

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.
