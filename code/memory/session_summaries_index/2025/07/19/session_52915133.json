User should be able to reset and play another game. Maintain and display points tally. Whoever gets 3 points first wins. Use ONLY ONE step of Coder Agent but use multiple iterations (call_self=True) to enhance visual appeal! You dont need any clarifications. Use beautiful theme and colour schemes, layout etc. You get extra money for making this visually appealing!",

If the timer expires, the other player wins the round.\n3.  The game keeps track of each player's score.\n4.  The first player to reach 3 points wins the game.\n5.  The game has a reset button to start a new game.\n6.  Focus on visual appeal. Use a beautiful theme, color scheme, and layout. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Focus on visual aspects with each iteration.\n7. Ensure visual enhancements are performed in iterations by leaving placeholders in the code to update in the next call, using well commented code blocks. Each iteration should focus on only ONE aspect to enhance it progressively.\n8. Call itself to progressively enhance the visual appeal of the game. DO NOT focus on logic, focus on visual appeal.\n\nFirst, focus on basic game logic and structure (HTML).\nSecond, focus on the timer implementation and its integration with the game.\nThird, focus on implementing score tracking and displaying the scores.\nFourth, focus on implementing the reset functionality.\nFifth, focus on visual enhancements using CSS to make the game more appealing.\nSixth, call yourself to further visual enhancements. Do this call multiple times.",
