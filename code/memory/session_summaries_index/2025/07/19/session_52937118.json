The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.carsauce.com/car-review/2026-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review', 'content': \"2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review - CarSauce LATEST car News expert Reviews Extra Sauce Search Car reviews Mahindra 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with good looks and great value in the small SUV segment, ready to take on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.quiklyz.com/blog/mahindra-uxv-3xo-review', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://whatinsider.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Auto Industry Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compelling sub-compact SUV with segment-leading safety, powerful engines and new style in the market. NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link The sub-compact SUV in India witnesseda huge disruption with the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in April 2024. This heavily redesigned XUV300 successor has created a lot of buzz in the market, promising to fix the shortcomings of the previous model and introduce segment-first features. Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO. While deliveries begin on May 26 it may be time before you get your hands on one if youre not one of those 50,000 people. Cons - Lack of AT with Diesel Adding the new 6-speed automatic gearbox in the mix was a good move by Mahindra.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Auto Industry Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compelling sub-compact SUV with segment-leading safety, powerful engines and new style in the market. NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link The sub-compact SUV in India witnesseda huge disruption with the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in April 2024. This heavily redesigned XUV300 successor has created a lot of buzz in the market, promising to fix the shortcomings of the previous model and introduce segment-first features. Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO. While deliveries begin on May 26 it may be time before you get your hands on one if youre not one of those 50,000 people. Cons - Lack of AT with Diesel Adding the new 6-speed automatic gearbox in the mix was a good move by Mahindra. But not giving it with the diesel engine may not have bee\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Author_Profile_Satvik_Khare_b734675426.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Author Profile Satvik Khare.jpg', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/1_ea5c7aa08c.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/3_XO_98df1eba27.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Prices_557c1bcab4.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Ride_quality_f185c5f54b.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cardekho.com/mahindra/xuv-3xo/user-reviews/safety/2?subtab=latest', 'content': \"Check 86 Safety Reviews & Ratings on Mahindra XUV 3XO All New Used Ad English Login / Register NEW CARS Explore New Cars Electric Cars Tesla Model Y Mahindra BE 6 Tata Harrier EV MG Windsor EV Mahindra XEV 9e Tata Nexon EV All Electric Cars Popular Cars Defender Hyundai Creta Mahindra Thar ROXX Tata Nexon Mahindra Scorpio Maruti Swift All Popular Cars Upcoming Cars New Launches Car Insurance Ad Popular Brands Maruti Cars Tata Cars Kia Cars Toyota Cars Hyundai Cars Mahindra Cars Compare Cars New Car Offers & Discounts Find Car Dealers Find EV Charging Stations Find Fuel Stations Check Fuel Prices Used cars Buy Used Cars Used Cars In Your City Ahmedabad Bangalore Chennai Delhi NCR Hyderabad Jaipur Kolkata Mumbai Pune More Cities Sell My Car Used Car Valuation Dealership Near Me News & Reviews News & Top stories Car Expert Reviews User Reviews Car Collection Tips & Advice Videos Video Reviews Visual Stories Select City Ad XUV 3XO Price Compare Offers Images Specs User Reviews 360 View Variants More Videos Mileage Colours XUV 3XO News FAQs Dealers Service Center Brochure XUV 3XO EMI Loan Second Hand XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Safety user reviews 4.6 303 Reviews Shortlist Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh * EMI starts @ 21,545 View July Offers Rating of Mahindra XUV 3XO 4.6 /5 Based on 303 User Reviews Write a Review & Win 1000 Safety user reviews of Mahindra XUV 3XO All (303) Mileage (59) Performance (86) Looks (100) Comfort (104) Engine (78) Interior (48) Power (50) Safety (86) More...

The XUV 3XO secured this accolade for both adult and child occupant protection, underlining Mahindras focus on providing world-class safety features in its vehicles. This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions. However, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings of adequate to marginal due to the impact forces recorded during the collision. Despite these minor deductions, protection to the driver's head, hip, and thigh was rated as good, reinforcing the XUV 3XOs overall structural integrity and crashworthiness. The XUV 3XO excelled in the side barrier and pole impact tests, securing a full 16 out of 16 points . These tests assess the SUVs ability to protect front-seat occupants in scenarios where side impacts pose a significant threat. Mahindras engineering expertise was evident, as the SUV delivered comprehensive protection to the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showcasing its robust design and stringent safety standards. In terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO also performed admirably, earning a total score of 43 out of 49 . While the SUV dropped a few points in the vehicle assessment score, it still received full marks in both the dynamic crash test and the child restraint system (CRS) parameters. The test evaluated the ability of child restraint systems to effectively secure young passengers during high-impact situations. The XUV 3XO accommodated CRS installations with ease, ensuring full protection for child passengers. Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level. The XUV 3XOs impressive safety performance is backed by a comprehensive suite of standard safety features. The SUV comes equipped with six airbags as a standard offering across all trims, ensuring superior protection for all occupants. Additionally, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) are standard, enhancing the vehicles stability and control in various driving conditions. Seat belt reminders are also provided for all seating positions, encouraging passengers to use seat belts at all times and thereby boosting overall safety. For customers opting for the higher-end variants, Mahindra offers Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) . This package includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking, adding another layer of safety and convenience for drivers. These technologies are designed to mitigate the risk of collisions and assist drivers in maintaining optimal control over the vehicle.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n**Mahindra XUV 3XO: A Comprehensive Safety Analysis**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO has entered the competitive subcompact SUV market with a strong emphasis on safety. The vehicle has secured a 5-star safety rating from Bharat NCAP, indicating a high level of occupant protection in simulated crash scenarios. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the XUV 3XO's safety features, compares them to industry benchmarks, and identifies potential areas for improvement.\n\n**Bharat NCAP Rating: A Detailed Breakdown**\n\nThe XUV 3XO's 5-star rating from Bharat NCAP is based on its performance in various crash tests. The key findings are:\n\n*   **Adult Occupant Protection:** Scored 29.36 out of 32 points. Excellent protection for the co-driver was noted, with 'good' ratings across all body regions. However, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings of 'adequate to marginal' due to impact forces.\n*   **Child Occupant Protection:** Scored 43 out of 49 points. The XUV 3XO performed admirably, securing full marks in both the dynamic crash test and the child restraint system (CRS) parameters.\n\nThe Bharat NCAP testing involved both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant, and the safety ratings are applicable across all variants, highlighting Mahindra’s commitment to consistent safety standards.\n\n**Standard Safety Features**\n\nThe XUV 3XO comes equipped with a range of standard safety features designed to protect occupants in the event of a collision and prevent accidents from occurring. These include:\n\n*   **Six Airbags:** Standard across all trims, providing enhanced protection for all occupants.\n*   **Electronic Stability Control (ESC):** Enhances vehicle stability and control, particularly in adverse driving conditions.\n*   **Anti-lock Braking System (ABS):** Prevents wheel lock-up during braking, improving steering control.\n*   **Seat Belt Reminders:** For all seating positions, encouraging seat belt use for all passengers.\n\n**Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**\n\nHigher-end variants of the XUV 3XO offer Level 2 ADAS, which includes a suite of advanced safety technologies designed to assist the driver and mitigate the risk of collisions. These features include:\n\n*   **Adaptive Cruise Control:** Automatically adjusts vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.\n*   **Lane-Keeping Assist:** Helps the driver keep the vehicle within its lane by providing steering assistance.\n*   **Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB):** Automatically applies the brakes to prevent or mitigate a collision.\n\n**Comparison to Industry Standards**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO's safety features and Bharat NCAP rating compare favorably to other subcompact SUVs in the Indian market. Many competitors offer similar standard safety features such as airbags, ABS, and ESC. However, the XUV 3XO's 5-star rating positions it as one of the safest vehicles in its class. Level 2 ADAS, while available on some competitors, is not as widely offered as standard, giving the XUV 3XO a competitive advantage.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO performs well in crash tests and offers a comprehensive suite of safety features, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n\n*   **Driver's Chest, Legs, and Feet Protection:** The 'adequate to marginal' ratings for the driver's chest, legs, and feet in the frontal offset deformable barrier test suggest that there is room for improvement in these areas. Mahindra could focus on enhancing the structural design and energy absorption capabilities of the vehicle's front end to provide better protection for the driver.\n*   **ADAS Performance:** While Level 2 ADAS is a valuable addition, the effectiveness of these systems depends on their calibration and performance in real-world driving conditions. Further testing and refinement of the ADAS algorithms could improve their reliability and effectiveness.\n*   **ADAS Availability:** While ADAS is available on higher-end variants, it is not offered on lower trims. Making ADAS available as an option across all trims could improve the overall safety of the XUV 3XO lineup.\n*   **Rollover Protection:** While the provided data mentions ESC, it doesn't explicitly detail rollover protection measures. Further information on rollover stability and roof strength would be beneficial.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following recommendations are made to further enhance the safety of the Mahindra XUV 3XO:\n\n1.  **Improve Driver Protection:** Focus on improving the protection of the driver's chest, legs, and feet in frontal collisions through structural enhancements and optimized energy absorption.\n2.  **Refine ADAS Performance:** Conduct extensive testing and refinement of the ADAS algorithms to improve their reliability and effectiveness in various driving scenarios.\n3.  **Expand ADAS Availability:** Offer ADAS as an option across all trims to make advanced safety technologies more accessible to a wider range of customers.\n4.  **Enhanced Rollover Protection:** Provide specific details about rollover protection measures, including roof strength and electronic stability control effectiveness in preventing rollovers.\n5.  **Public Awareness:** Educate consumers about the safety features of the XUV 3XO and how they contribute to overall vehicle safety. This can help increase customer confidence and drive sales.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO is a safe and well-equipped subcompact SUV that offers a high level of occupant protection. Its 5-star Bharat NCAP rating and comprehensive suite of standard safety features make it a competitive choice in the Indian market.

These features, including premium interior materials, advanced technology, and comfort enhancements, appeal to a target demographic seeking value and style. However, the effectiveness of these features is contingent on their execution, reliability, and overall contribution to a premium feel.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The Mahindra XUV 3XO aims to democratize luxury by offering features typically found in higher-priced vehicles within the compact SUV segment. A thorough analysis of these features is essential to understand their value, appeal to the target customer, and overall contribution to the ownership experience.\n\n**Interior Materials and Design:**\nThe XUV 3XO boasts features like soft-touch leatherette on door trims and dashboard, and premium leatherette seats in certain variants. The perceived luxury of these materials relies on their quality, durability, and the overall design aesthetic. While leatherette offers a more premium feel than standard fabric, it's crucial to assess its tactile quality and resistance to wear and tear. The design of the dashboard and door trims also contributes to the overall sense of luxury. A well-designed interior can elevate the perceived value of even relatively inexpensive materials.\n\n*Value Assessment:* Leatherette seats and soft-touch materials contribute to a more upscale cabin environment. However, the specific type and quality of the leatherette used are important factors. High-quality leatherette can closely mimic the look and feel of genuine leather, while lower-quality versions may feel plasticky or artificial.\n\n*Target Customer Appeal:* For the target customer seeking a stylish and comfortable vehicle, these interior upgrades can be a significant draw. They provide a tangible sense of luxury without the hefty price tag of genuine leather.\n\n*Contribution to Ownership Experience:* A more comfortable and visually appealing interior enhances the driving experience. However, the durability and ease of maintenance of these materials are also important considerations.\n\n**Comfort and Convenience Features:**\nThe vehicle features a skyroof (sunroof), cooled glovebox with illumination, passive keyless entry, a front armrest with storage, and a console with a cup holder. These features enhance convenience and comfort, contributing to a more relaxed and enjoyable driving experience.\n\n*Value Assessment:* The skyroof adds a sense of spaciousness and airiness to the cabin. The cooled glovebox is a practical feature for keeping beverages and snacks cool, especially in hot weather. Passive keyless entry enhances convenience by allowing drivers to unlock and start the car without using a key. The armrest and cup holder provide added comfort and convenience for both driver and passengers.\n\n*Target Customer Appeal:* These features align well with the needs of a target customer seeking a comfortable and convenient vehicle for daily commutes and weekend trips. The skyroof is particularly appealing to those who value a sense of openness and connection to the outdoors.\n\n*Contribution to Ownership Experience:* These comfort and convenience features contribute significantly to the overall ownership experience by making the vehicle more user-friendly and enjoyable to drive.\n\n**Infotainment and Connectivity:**\nThe XUV 3XO includes a Harman Kardon 7-speaker audio system, a high-definition touchscreen system for infotainment and navigation, and built-in Amazon Alexa integration. These features enhance entertainment and connectivity, providing a modern and immersive driving experience.\n\n*Value Assessment:* The Harman Kardon audio system delivers high-quality sound, enhancing the enjoyment of music and podcasts. The high-definition touchscreen provides a clear and responsive interface for accessing infotainment and navigation features. Amazon Alexa integration allows drivers to control various vehicle functions using voice commands.\n\n*Target Customer Appeal:* The target customer, particularly younger demographics, is likely to value these advanced technology features. A high-quality audio system and seamless connectivity are essential for many drivers today.\n\n*Contribution to Ownership Experience:* These features significantly enhance the driving experience by providing entertainment, information, and connectivity on the go. However, the user-friendliness and reliability of the infotainment system are crucial factors.\n\n**Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS):**\nWhile not explicitly mentioned in the provided data, Level-2 ADAS is highlighted as a USP in some sources. This includes features like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency braking, which enhance safety and driving convenience.\n\n*Value Assessment:* ADAS features add significant value by improving safety and reducing driver fatigue. These systems can help prevent accidents and make driving more comfortable, especially on long trips.\n\n*Target Customer Appeal:* Safety is a high priority for many car buyers, and ADAS features can be a major selling point. These features appeal to customers who value safety and convenience.\n\n*Contribution to Ownership Experience:* ADAS features enhance the overall driving experience by making the vehicle safer and more comfortable to drive. However, the effectiveness and reliability of these systems are crucial factors.\n\n**Comparison to Competitors:**\nTo truly assess the luxury features of the XUV 3XO, it's essential to compare them to those offered by competitors in the compact SUV segment, such as the Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue, and Maruti Suzuki Brezza. The XUV 3XO's features need to stand out in terms of quality, functionality, and value to be considered a competitive advantage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO offers a range of luxury features that aim to enhance the ownership experience and appeal to a target customer seeking value and style. These features, including premium interior materials, advanced technology, and comfort enhancements, contribute to a more upscale and enjoyable driving experience. However, the success of these features depends on their execution, reliability, and overall contribution to a premium feel. Continuous improvement and a focus on customer feedback are essential for Mahindra to maintain a competitive edge in the compact SUV segment.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n*   **Conduct thorough quality control:** Ensure all luxury features meet high standards of quality and durability.\n*   **Gather customer feedback:** Continuously collect feedback on the perceived value and effectiveness of the luxury features.\n*   **Compare against competitors:** Regularly assess the XUV 3XO's features against those of its competitors to identify areas for improvement.\n*   **Invest in marketing:** Highlight the luxury features in marketing materials to attract the target customer.\n*   **Offer customization options:** Provide customers with options to customize the luxury features to suit their individual preferences.\n\n**Risks or Warnings:**\n*   **Overstating luxury:** Avoid overstating the 'luxury' aspect if the features are merely 'premium' for the segment, as this could lead to customer disappointment.\n*   **Reliability issues:** Any reliability issues with the luxury features could damage the brand's reputation and negatively impact customer satisfaction.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n*   Interior Materials and Design\n*   Comfort and Convenience Features\n*   Infotainment and Connectivity\n*   Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)\n*   Comparison to Competitors",

However, year-on-year (YoY) analysis shows a significant growth of 80% in FY2025, driven by the introduction of the refreshed XUV 3XO model in April 2024. This indicates that the model refresh has been a crucial factor in boosting sales.\n\n*   **June 2025 Sales:** 7,089 units (10.85% MoM decline)\n*   **FY2025 Growth (Up to Jan 2025):** 80% YoY increase\n*   **Cumulative Sales (Since launch):** 335,017 units (as of end-January 2025)\n\n### Key Sales Drivers\n\n1.  **Model Refresh (XUV 3XO):** The introduction of the XUV 3XO in April 2024 has significantly accelerated sales.

This growth was driven by the Scorpio/N and Thar/ROXX models, which more than doubled their sales.\n*   **Mahindra's Market Share:** Mahindra held a 14.9% market share in June 2025, ranking as the second best-selling automaker. Total wholesales were 47,306 SUVs.\n*   **Model-Specific Trends:** The Scorpio/N topped sales charts with 12,740 units. The Thar/ROXX followed with 9,542 units. The Bolero recorded 7,478 unit sales.

Price hikes of up to Rs 30,000 were implemented for select variants.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Auto Industry Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compelling sub-compact SUV with segment-leading safety, powerful engines and new style in the market. NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link The sub-compact SUV in India witnesseda huge disruption with the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in April 2024. This heavily redesigned XUV300 successor has created a lot of buzz in the market, promising to fix the shortcomings of the previous model and introduce segment-first features. Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO. While deliveries begin on May 26 it may be time before you get your hands on one if youre not one of those 50,000 people. Cons - Lack of AT with Diesel Adding the new 6-speed automatic gearbox in the mix was a good move by Mahindra. But not giving it with the diesel engine may not have bee\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Author_Profile_Satvik_Khare_b734675426.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Author Profile Satvik Khare.jpg', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/1_ea5c7aa08c.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/3_XO_98df1eba27.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Prices_557c1bcab4.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Ride_quality_f185c5f54b.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cardekho.com/mahindra/xuv-3xo/user-reviews/safety/2?subtab=latest', 'content': \"Check 86 Safety Reviews & Ratings on Mahindra XUV 3XO All New Used Ad English Login / Register NEW CARS Explore New Cars Electric Cars Tesla Model Y Mahindra BE 6 Tata Harrier EV MG Windsor EV Mahindra XEV 9e Tata Nexon EV All Electric Cars Popular Cars Defender Hyundai Creta Mahindra Thar ROXX Tata Nexon Mahindra Scorpio Maruti Swift All Popular Cars Upcoming Cars New Launches Car Insurance Ad Popular Brands Maruti Cars Tata Cars Kia Cars Toyota Cars Hyundai Cars Mahindra Cars Compare Cars New Car Offers & Discounts Find Car Dealers Find EV Charging Stations Find Fuel Stations Check Fuel Prices Used cars Buy Used Cars Used Cars In Your City Ahmedabad Bangalore Chennai Delhi NCR Hyderabad Jaipur Kolkata Mumbai Pune More Cities Sell My Car Used Car Valuation Dealership Near Me News & Reviews News & Top stories Car Expert Reviews User Reviews Car Collection Tips & Advice Videos Video Reviews Visual Stories Select City Ad XUV 3XO Price Compare Offers Images Specs User Reviews 360 View Variants More Videos Mileage Colours XUV 3XO News FAQs Dealers Service Center Brochure XUV 3XO EMI Loan Second Hand XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Safety user reviews 4.6 303 Reviews Shortlist Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh * EMI starts @ 21,545 View July Offers Rating of Mahindra XUV 3XO 4.6 /5 Based on 303 User Reviews Write a Review & Win 1000 Safety user reviews of Mahindra XUV 3XO All (303) Mileage (59) Performance (86) Looks (100) Comfort (104) Engine (78) Interior (48) Power (50) Safety (86) More...

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Auto Industry Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compelling sub-compact SUV with segment-leading safety, powerful engines and new style in the market. NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link The sub-compact SUV in India witnesseda huge disruption with the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in April 2024. This heavily redesigned XUV300 successor has created a lot of buzz in the market, promising to fix the shortcomings of the previous model and introduce segment-first features. Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO. While deliveries begin on May 26 it may be time before you get your hands on one if youre not one of those 50,000 people. Cons - Lack of AT with Diesel Adding the new 6-speed automatic gearbox in the mix was a good move by Mahindra. But not giving it with the diesel engine may not have bee\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Author_Profile_Satvik_Khare_b734675426.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Author Profile Satvik Khare.jpg', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/1_ea5c7aa08c.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/3_XO_98df1eba27.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Prices_557c1bcab4.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/Ride_quality_f185c5f54b.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra', 'width': '740', 'height': '400', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cardekho.com/mahindra/xuv-3xo/user-reviews/safety/2?subtab=latest', 'content': \"Check 86 Safety Reviews & Ratings on Mahindra XUV 3XO All New Used Ad English Login / Register NEW CARS Explore New Cars Electric Cars Tesla Model Y Mahindra BE 6 Tata Harrier EV MG Windsor EV Mahindra XEV 9e Tata Nexon EV All Electric Cars Popular Cars Defender Hyundai Creta Mahindra Thar ROXX Tata Nexon Mahindra Scorpio Maruti Swift All Popular Cars Upcoming Cars New Launches Car Insurance Ad Popular Brands Maruti Cars Tata Cars Kia Cars Toyota Cars Hyundai Cars Mahindra Cars Compare Cars New Car Offers & Discounts Find Car Dealers Find EV Charging Stations Find Fuel Stations Check Fuel Prices Used cars Buy Used Cars Used Cars In Your City Ahmedabad Bangalore Chennai Delhi NCR Hyderabad Jaipur Kolkata Mumbai Pune More Cities Sell My Car Used Car Valuation Dealership Near Me News & Reviews News & Top stories Car Expert Reviews User Reviews Car Collection Tips & Advice Videos Video Reviews Visual Stories Select City Ad XUV 3XO Price Compare Offers Images Specs User Reviews 360 View Variants More Videos Mileage Colours XUV 3XO News FAQs Dealers Service Center Brochure XUV 3XO EMI Loan Second Hand XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Safety user reviews 4.6 303 Reviews Shortlist Rs. 7.99 - 15.80 Lakh * EMI starts @ 21,545 View July Offers Rating of Mahindra XUV 3XO 4.6 /5 Based on 303 User Reviews Write a Review & Win 1000 Safety user reviews of Mahindra XUV 3XO All (303) Mileage (59) Performance (86) Looks (100) Comfort (104) Engine (78) Interior (48) Power (50) Safety (86) More...

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.quiklyz.com/blog/mahindra-uxv-3xo-review', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://whatinsider.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-feature-and-power-packed-compact-suv-431439', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Auto Industry Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compelling sub-compact SUV with segment-leading safety, powerful engines and new style in the market. NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link The sub-compact SUV in India witnesseda huge disruption with the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in April 2024. This heavily redesigned XUV300 successor has created a lot of buzz in the market, promising to fix the shortcomings of the previous model and introduce segment-first features. Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO.

The XUV 3XO secured this accolade for both adult and child occupant protection, underlining Mahindras focus on providing world-class safety features in its vehicles. This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions. However, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings of adequate to marginal due to the impact forces recorded during the collision. Despite these minor deductions, protection to the driver's head, hip, and thigh was rated as good, reinforcing the XUV 3XOs overall structural integrity and crashworthiness. The XUV 3XO excelled in the side barrier and pole impact tests, securing a full 16 out of 16 points . These tests assess the SUVs ability to protect front-seat occupants in scenarios where side impacts pose a significant threat. Mahindras engineering expertise was evident, as the SUV delivered comprehensive protection to the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showcasing its robust design and stringent safety standards. In terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO also performed admirably, earning a total score of 43 out of 49 . While the SUV dropped a few points in the vehicle assessment score, it still received full marks in both the dynamic crash test and the child restraint system (CRS) parameters. The test evaluated the ability of child restraint systems to effectively secure young passengers during high-impact situations. The XUV 3XO accommodated CRS installations with ease, ensuring full protection for child passengers. Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level. The XUV 3XOs impressive safety performance is backed by a comprehensive suite of standard safety features. The SUV comes equipped with six airbags as a standard offering across all trims, ensuring superior protection for all occupants. Additionally, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) are standard, enhancing the vehicles stability and control in various driving conditions. Seat belt reminders are also provided for all seating positions, encouraging passengers to use seat belts at all times and thereby boosting overall safety. For customers opting for the higher-end variants, Mahindra offers Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) . This package includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking, adding another layer of safety and convenience for drivers. These technologies are designed to mitigate the risk of collisions and assist drivers in maintaining optimal control over the vehicle. The XUV 3XOs success in the Bharat NCAP crash tests is a testament to Mahindras dedication to vehicle safety. It demonstrates the brands ability to design and manufacture vehicles that meet stringent safety standards, providing Indian consumers wi\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.carandbike.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.carandbike.com%2Fcar-images%2Fbig%2Fmahindra%2Fxuv-3xo%2Fmahindra-xuv-3xo.jpg%3Fv%3D28&w=640&q=75', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'width': '300', 'height': '200', 'class': 'ppImage imgFull', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carandbike.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1SqjzUbqbfk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&w=640&q=75', 'alt_text': 'carandbike - Maruti Suzuki SPresso, Ignis, Swift Crash Tested By GNCAP] Receive 1 Star Safety Rating', 'width': '300', 'height': '230', 'class': 'vcImage', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carandbike.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fzywc0xOXEo8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&w=640&q=75', 'alt_text': 'carandbike - Mahindra Scorpio-N Crash Tested } Another 5 Star SUV From Mahindra', 'width': '300', 'height': '230', 'class': 'vcImage', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carandbike.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ffyj0Sa3YIpw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&w=640&q=75', 'alt_text': 'carandbike - Mahindra XUV700 | EXCLUSIVE | Scores 5 Star Rating in Global NCAP Crash Test #XUV700CrashTest #SVP', 'width': '300', 'height': '230', 'class': 'vcImage', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.carandbike.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FP0GNIESXyEw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&w=640&q=75', 'alt_text': 'carandbike - Exclusive: Tata Punch Gets 5 Stars in Crash Test by Global NCAP #SaferCarsForIndia | carandbike', 'width': '300', 'height': '230', 'class': 'vcImage', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://ackodrive.com/car-guide/mahindra-xuv-3xo-features-explained/', 'content': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: Your Complete Guide HOME BUY NEW CAR BLOG Home / Articles / Car Guide / Mahindra XUV 3XO Features Explained: A Comprehensive Guide.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: ## Mahindra XUV 3XO Sales Data and Trend Analysis\n\nThis report analyzes the sales data and trends for the Mahindra XUV 3XO, identifies potential drivers of sales performance, and provides a comparison with its competitors based on available data. The analysis is based on web search results gathered up to June 2025.\n\n### Sales Performance Overview\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO has shown a mix of positive and negative sales trends. In June 2025, sales totaled 7,089 units, representing a 10.85% month-over-month (MoM) decline. However, year-on-year (YoY) analysis shows a significant growth of 80% in FY2025, driven by the introduction of the refreshed XUV 3XO model in April 2024. This indicates that the model refresh has been a crucial factor in boosting sales.\n\n*   **June 2025 Sales:** 7,089 units (10.85% MoM decline)\n*   **FY2025 Growth (Up to Jan 2025):** 80% YoY increase\n*   **Cumulative Sales (Since launch):** 335,017 units (as of end-January 2025)\n\n### Key Sales Drivers\n\n1.  **Model Refresh (XUV 3XO):** The introduction of the XUV 3XO in April 2024 has significantly accelerated sales. Year-on-year, Mahindra has sold an additional 38,318 units due to the new model. The refreshed model accounted for 85,990 units sold in the first 10 months of FY2025, surpassing the previous best of 60,968 units in FY2023.\n2.  **Safety Ratings:** Mahindra's heightened focus on safety, with the XUV 3XO, Thar Roxx, and XUV400 achieving 5-star Bharat NCAP crash test ratings, has positively influenced consumer perception and sales.\n3.  **New Variant Launches (XUV 3XO RevX):** The launch of the new XUV 3XO RevX is expected to further increase sales in the coming months.\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO competes in the B2-segment SUV market. Key competitors include:\n\n*   Kia Sonet\n*   Hyundai Venue\n*   Tata Nexon\n*   Maruti Brezza\n*   Renault Kiger\n*   Citroen C3\n*   Maruti Fronx\n*   Nissan Magnite\n\nWhile specific sales data for these competitors is not provided in the search results, the documents reference their existence. For example, V3Cars.com mentions the Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, Tata Nexon, and Maruti Brezza, among others. Carbike360.com also lists the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, and Tata Punch.\n\n### Sales Trends\n\n*   **Growth in Q2 CY2025:** Mahindra posted a 22.39% YoY growth in overall sales for Q2 CY2025, selling 152,067 units compared to 124,248 units in Q2 CY2024. This growth was driven by the Scorpio/N and Thar/ROXX models, which more than doubled their sales.\n*   **Mahindra's Market Share:** Mahindra held a 14.9% market share in June 2025, ranking as the second best-selling automaker. Total wholesales were 47,306 SUVs.\n*   **Model-Specific Trends:** The Scorpio/N topped sales charts with 12,740 units. The Thar/ROXX followed with 9,542 units. The Bolero recorded 7,478 unit sales. The XUV700 had 6,198 unit sales. Electric SUVs, XEV 9e and BE 6, contributed 2,808 and 1,203 units respectively. XUV400 sales declined significantly to 231 units.\n\n### Impact of Pricing\n\nThere are references to price increases for the XUV 3XO, effective from October 6th. Price hikes of up to Rs 30,000 were implemented for select variants. The impact of these price changes on sales figures needs to be further investigated.\n\n### Detailed Sales Figures\n\n| Month    | Sales No. | Source       |\n| -------- | --------- | ------------ |\n| Jan 2025 | 8,454     | v3cars.com   |\n| Feb 2025 | 7,861     | v3cars.com   |\n| Mar 2025 | 7,055     | v3cars.com   |\n| Apr 2025 | 7,568     | v3cars.com   |\n| May 2025 | 7,952     | v3cars.com   |\n| Jun 2025 | 7,089     | v3cars.com   |\n\n### Recommendation\n\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of the XUV 3XO's performance, it is recommended to:\n\n1.
