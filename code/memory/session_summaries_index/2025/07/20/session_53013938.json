Use ONLY ONE step of CoderAgent but use MULTIPLE ITERATIONS (call_self=True) of the same step to enrich the game logic, visual or layout! You dont need any clarifications. You dont need to build reports. Use beautiful theme and colour schemes, layout etc. You get extra money for making this visually appealing!",

      "agent_prompt": "You are tasked with creating a Tic Tac Toe game with the following specifications:\n\n1.  **Game Logic:** Implement the core Tic Tac Toe game logic, ensuring that players can take turns marking cells, and the game correctly detects a winner or a draw.\n2.  **Scoring System:** Implement a scoring system that awards a point to the winning player. The score should be persistently displayed throughout the game.\n3.  **Reset Functionality:** Implement a reset button that allows players to start a new game without refreshing the page. Resetting the game should not reset the score.\n4.  **Visual Appeal:** Create a visually appealing user interface with a beautiful theme, color scheme, and layout. The game should be engaging and aesthetically pleasing. Use modern CSS techniques for styling.\n5.  **File Separation:** The code must be separated into three files:\n    *   `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.\n    *   `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the game.\n    *   `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the game.\n6.  **Multiple Iterations:** You are allowed to call yourself multiple times to enrich the game logic, visual elements, or layout. In each subsequent call, consider the current state of the code and build upon it.\n7.  **Placeholders for Future Updates:** Leave placeholders (comments) in the code where future updates or enhancements can be easily added.\n8.  **Scoring display**: The scoring display should be prominent and visually appealing, using CSS to make it stand out.\n\nBased on previous runs, you will receive the current versions of `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` in the `inputs` field. Analyze these files and iteratively improve the game based on the specifications above. Remember to maintain the file separation and use placeholders for future updates.  Ensure the game is fully functional, visually appealing, and meets all the specified requirements. Ensure the game is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes. All the files must be self-contained in the code block at the end.\n\nOutput the modified or newly generated code for `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` in the `code` field with proper naming.  The code output must be complete and ready to run, with proper HTML structure and CSS styling. Also output the execution `output` to show the game works, including the HTML/CSS and JavaScript files to run the game. If you want to test after this run, you must leave placeholders for next call.",
