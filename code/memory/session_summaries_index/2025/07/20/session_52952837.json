SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry.

For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles.

The report also helps stakeholders understand the pulse of the market and provides them with information on key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities. The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies. Further, the introduction of autonomous SUVs with enhanced safety features and higher level of automation is shifting the trends in the SUV market. Moreover, OEMs are focused on reducing the production cost of the vehicle by standadizing the platform technology and planning & developing unique platforms for all the SUVs under their brand. Furthermore, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) SUVs can be a major break-through in the SUVs market. Although the FCEV technology is still in the initial stages, planned research & development is carried out and can become a next major factor in the overall automotive industry, SUVs included. In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s. Autonomous SUVs are anticipated to witness growth Autonomous SUVs are projected to grow significantly during the forecast due to the rising demand for safety, comfort, and driving convenience features.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,093 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Team Spinny Last updated 3 months ago As we all know the safety of a vehicle is one of the most important attributes in current times. People want a car that not only delivers on performance and efficiency but also stands out with its safety features. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is making headlines as one of the safest small SUVs in India. This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is. NCAP, or the New Car Assessment Program, conducts crash tests to see how well a vehicle can protect its occupants in an accident. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has performed well in its NCAP tests. It was tested under Bharat NCAP (BNCAP), which is Indias version of the global safety program. The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest.

Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Child Occupant Protection Rating Child safety is another critical aspect of a cars overall safety rating. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating for child occupants is 43 out of 49 points , which is an excellent score. This means the car provides solid protection for children in case of an accident. Some of the key factors that contributed to this rating include: ISOFIX Child Seat Anchors: These allow parents to securely install child safety seats, reducing the risk of movement in case of impact. Dynamic Score: The XUV 3XO performed well in crash tests with child dummies,', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Spinny-2024-Hyundai-Creta-800x450.webp', 'alt_text': 'Hyundai Creta', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-519796 not-transparent', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Kia-Seltos-FR-Red-800x450.png', 'alt_text': 'Kia Sonet', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-517794 has-transparency', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Kia-Seltos-FR-Red-800x450.png', 'alt_text': 'Kia Sonet', 'width': '800', 'height': '450', 'class': 'attachment-medium size-medium wp-image-517794 has-transparency', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.cars24.com/news/auto/mahindra-xuv-3xo-safety-rating-secures-5-stars-in-bharat-ncap/', 'content': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating Secures 5 stars in Bharat NCAP New Cars Explore new cars Compare News All cars Upcoming cars Nissan brand store Popular brands Maruti Suzuki Hyundai Tata Mahindra Toyota Kia Honda Popular cars Hyundai Creta Mahindra Thar Tata Nexon Tata Punch Maruti Swift Kia Syros Skoda Kylaq Cars by body type Sedan SUV Hatchback MUV Cars by price range Under 5 Lakh Under 10 Lakh Under 15 Lakh Under 20 Lakh Explore new cars Compare News All cars Upcoming cars Nissan brand store Popular brands Maruti Suzuki Hyundai Tata Mahindra Toyota Kia Honda Popular cars Hyundai Creta Mahindra Thar Tata Nexon Tata Punch Maruti Swift Kia Syros Skoda Kylaq Cars by body type Sedan SUV Hatchback MUV Cars by price range Under 5 Lakh Under 10 Lakh Under 15 Lakh Under 20 Lakh Autoverse News Auto insider Reviews Auto discussions Car advice Articles News Auto insider Reviews Auto discussions Car advice Articles Buy used car Used cars in Delhi NCR Used cars in New Delhi Used cars in Mumbai Used cars in Bangalore Used cars in Hyderabad Used cars in Ahmedabad Used cars in Gurgaon Used cars in Chennai Used cars in Pune Used cars in Noida Used cars in Ghaziabad Used cars in Lucknow Used cars in Jaipur Used cars in Kolkata Used cars in Kochi Used cars in Indore Used cars in India Used cars in Delhi NCR Used cars in New Delhi Used cars in Mumbai Used cars in Bangalore Used cars in Hyderabad Used cars in Ahmedabad Used cars in Gurgaon Used cars in Chennai Used cars in Pune Used cars in Noida Used cars in Ghaziabad Used cars in Lucknow Used cars in Jaipur Used cars in Kolkata Used cars in Kochi Used cars in Indore Used cars in India Sell car Used Car Valuation Sell car In Delhi Sell car In Mumbai Sell car In Bangalore Sell car In Hyderabad Sell car In Ahmedabad Sell car In Gurgaon Sell car In Chennai Sell car In Pune Sell car In Noida Sell car In Ghaziabad Sell car In Lucknow Sell car In Jaipur Sell car In Kolkata Sell car In Kochi Sell car In Indore Sell car online Used Car Valuation Sell car In Delhi Sell car In Mumbai Sell car In Bangalore Sell car In Hyderabad Sell car In Ahmedabad Sell car In Gurgaon Sell car In Chennai Sell car In Pune Sell car In Noida Sell car In Ghaziabad Sell car In Lucknow Sell car In Jaipur Sell car In Kolkata Sell car In Kochi Sell car In Indore Sell car online Car finance Used car loan Used car loan eligibility Used car loan interest rates Used car EMI calculator Used car loan Used car loan eligibility Used car loan interest rates Used car EMI calculator Car services View & pay challan Car service history Car scrap Check vehicle details Pre delivery inspection Driving School View & pay challan Car service history Car scrap Check vehicle details Pre delivery inspection Driving School Login Login Auto News Personal loan Auto News Personal loan Home Auto Insider Reviews Ad Ad Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating Secures 5 stars in Bharat NCAP 15 Nov 2024 2 Mins read Outline Outline 5-star rating for adult occupant protection Child occupant protection receives 5-star rating Mahindra XUV 3XO safety: Whats included?

Sales of models like the Chevrolet Trax surged by 130% in a recent period, indicating a strong shift towards compact SUVs. Similarly, in Germany, compact cars have seen a resurgence.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry.

The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies. Further, the introduction of autonomous SUVs with enhanced safety features and higher level of automation is shifting the trends in the SUV market. Moreover, OEMs are focused on reducing the production cost of the vehicle by standadizing the platform technology and planning & developing unique platforms for all the SUVs under their brand. Furthermore, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) SUVs can be a major break-through in the SUVs market. Although the FCEV technology is still in the initial stages, planned research & development is carried out and can become a next major factor in the overall automotive industry, SUVs included. In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,093 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,093 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700.

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?
