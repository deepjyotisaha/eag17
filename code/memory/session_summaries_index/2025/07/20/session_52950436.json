Use ONLY ONE step of CoderAgent but use MULTIPLE ITERATIONS (call_self=True) of the same step to enrich the game logic, visual or layout! You dont need any clarifications. You dont need to build reports. Use beautiful theme and colour schemes, layout etc. You get extra money for making this visually appealing!

I will create placeholders for future enhancements. Since the user requested iterative enrichment, I'll make sure the code is well-commented and maintainable. The user also wants me to call self to enrich the game. The game should also be visually appealing. I will start with a basic implementation and then enrich it with each iteration by calling myself.
