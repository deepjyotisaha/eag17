SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/suv-market-108263', 'content': 'SUV Market Size, Trends | Growth [2033] SUV Market Industries Information & Technology Healthcare Machinery & Equipment Automotive & Transportation Food & Beverages Energy & Power Aerospace & Defense Agriculture Chemicals & Materials Architecture Consumer Goods Blogs About Contact Home Automotive & Transportation SUV Market SUV Market Size, Share, Growth, and Industry Analysis, By Types (Diesel, Petrol, Others) , Applications (Remote areas, Recreation, Motorsport) and Regional Insights and Forecast to 2033 Request a FREE Sample PDF Buy Now Last Updated: June 30 , 2025 Base Year: 2024 Historical Data: 2020-2023 No of Pages: 109 SKU ID: 25204558 Request a FREE Sample PDF Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Request a FREE Sample PDF SUV Market Size The global SUV market size was valued at USD 2.97 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 3.04 billion in 2025, eventually expanding to USD 3.71 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 2.5% from 2025 to 2033.

This article explores the journey, specifications, features, and impact of this groundbreaking vehicle. Genesis and Evolution The Mahindra XUV 3XO marks a significant evolution in Mahindras compact SUV lineup. Based on the X100 platform shared with the KGM Tivoli, this vehicle follows the successful XUV300 that had established Mahindra as a serious contender in the competitive sub-4-meter SUV segment. The naming convention3XOcleverly represents an evolution and enhancement of the original formula, signifying the vehicles position as more than just a mere facelift.

The automotive giant recognized the need to up its game while preserving the core strengths that made the XUV300 popularrobust build quality, powerful engines, and focus on safety. The result is a vehicle that maintains its predecessors DNA while introducing contemporary design elements and cutting-edge technology. Design Philosophy The XUV 3XOs design represents a bold departure from its predecessor while maintaining family resemblance to Mahindras broader SUV lineup. The front fascia commands attention with its striking C-shaped LED daytime running lights (DRLs) and a redesigned grille featuring triangular elements and chrome accents. The LED projector headlamps are neatly integrated into the face, creating a sophisticated and modern appearance. From the side profile, the XUV 3XO carries forward the proportions of the XUV300, with a strong shoulder line and pronounced wheel arches housing stylish 17-inch alloy wheels in top-spec variants. The rear sees a significant update with connected LED taillights and a light bar spanning the tailgatea feature increasingly popular in premium vehicles.

Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks.

Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely!

AUTO PUNDITZ January 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Feb 20 5 min read In this January 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Gunning For The 2nd Spot While their usual sales heroes like the Scorpio and XUV700 have been performing well for several years now, the 3XO along with some help from Thar Roxx, Mahindra are shaking up the auto industry. And this behaviour isnt going to change. With the BE6 and XEV 9e, they have conveyed that theyre not just here to sell electric cars. Theyre here to set new benchmarks in terms of value and features. The pricing of these 2 EVs has shaken up not just carmakers like Hyundai, Tata and Maruti but also the Chinese/Chinese-owned carmakers like MG and BYD are feeling the sting. So much so that MG jacked up the prices of the ZS while leaving the base price unchanged. On top of that, they are willing to give away discounts of up to ~Rs. 2.50 lakh on the base trim, which is the highest we have ever seen. So, the price hike was just a smoke screen when in reality, they are feeling the pinch from Mahindras BE6 and the Tata Curvv EV. We were counting on having a price war in the EV space in the 2025 - 28 period but a non-Chinese carmaker would take the first swing that, we didnt expect. The first swing will come from an Indian carmaker, that didnt just come as a surprise, it came as a shock. Its not this move that should scare the Chinese and even other carmakers. Its their attitude and hunger for greater market share, which should scare their rivals. The EV strategy suggests that this time around, they arent just going for one more bite out of the pie. They want the whole pie to themselves. Of course, it's not going to be easy but it looks like they are gunning for it anyway. That should make Hyundai very worried as they have maintained their hold on the 2nd spot in the Indian car market for God knows how long. Carmaker Jan 2025 Jan 2024 YoY% 12M Avg Maruti 1,73,599 1,66,802 +4.07% 1,46,850 Hyundai 54,003 57,013 -5.28% 50,193 Mahindra 50,659 43,068 +17.63% 44,950 Tata 48,075 53,635 -10.37% 46,409 Compared to Jan 2024, Mahindra and Maruti have gained market share while Hyundai and Tata have lost. Mahindra's YoY gains of 17.63% come across as enormous compared to Marutis. However, the YoY decline of 10.37% in Tatas sales suggests that they have graduated from 4th spot to 3rd. Since Hyundai also appear to have suffered some YoY decline in Jan 2025, its not too far-fetched to imagine that once Mahindra are feeling secure in the 3rd spot, they will be preparing to displace Hyundai from the 2nd spot. In average sales, though, Hyundai remain firmly in the 2nd spot while Tata in 3rd spot. Mahindra are in the 4th spot with an average shortage of 1459 every month. We expect them to easily make up this gap and create a larger gap for Tata to crawl in this calendar year. For 2025, Tata are also lining up the Sierra petrol/diesel and Sierra EV along with the Harrier EV. Mahindra are likely to bring a 3-row electric car (similar t\", 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://gaadiwaadi.com/9000-units-of-mahindra-xuv-3xo-sold-in-august-2024-80-growth/', 'content': 'Cars News Bikes News Auto Industry News Mod Job Gaadiwaadi.com Latest Car & Bike News CARS NEWS BIKES NEWS AUTO INDUSTRY NEWS MOD JOB Home Cars News 9,000 Units Of Mahindra XUV 3XO Sold In August 2024, 80% Growth By Surendhar M - September 7, 2024 Pic Source: Hari Haran Mahindra XUV 3XO posted 9,000 units in the month of August 2024 as against 4,992 units with a YoY sales growth of 80 per cent In late May, M&M marked the first day of deliveries for the XUV 3XO by handing over 1,500 units to customers nationwide. The response was remarkable, as the automaker received over 50,000 bookings within just an hour of opening reservations. Interestingly, nearly 70 per cent of the bookings were for the petrol variants of this compact SUV. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has been a key contributor to the brands sales figures since its debut. In its first month on sale in May 2024, 10,000 units were dispatched. The compact SUV has maintained this momentum over the following months, with August 2024 seeing a strong performance of 9,000 units, nearly doubling the 4,992 units sold in the same month last year. This resulted in a significant year-on-year sales growth of 80 per cent for the Mahindra XUV 3XO. However, MoM figures showed a 10 per cent decline, as 10,000 units were sold in July 2024. The XUV 3XO is available in nine trim levels namely MX1, MX2, MX2 Pro, MX3, MX3 Pro, AX5, AX5 Luxury, AX7, and AX7 Luxury. Although the MX3 Pro offers excellent value for money, the feature-packed AX5 and AX5 Luxury variants remain popular choices among buyers. Also Read:Mahindra XUV 3XO Most Detailed Review & Mileage Test Consumers tend to favour the petrol variants over the diesel versions of the Mahindra XUV 3XO, primarily due to the notable price gap between the two fuel options. The compact SUV is offered with three engine choices: a 1.2L petrol, a 1.2L direct injection petrol and a 1.5L diesel. The 1.2L petrol engine produces 115 PS and 200 Nm of torque while the more powerful 1.2L DI variant delivers 130 PS and 250 Nm of torque. The 1.5L four-cylinder diesel engine in the Mahindra XUV 3XO generates 117 PS and 300 Nm of torque. Transmission options include a six-speed manual, a six-speed AMT and a six-speed TC. Compared to its predecessor, the rebranded XUV 3XO boasts a larger boot, enhancing its practicality.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/suv-market-108263', 'content': 'SUV Market Size, Trends | Growth [2033] SUV Market Industries Information & Technology Healthcare Machinery & Equipment Automotive & Transportation Food & Beverages Energy & Power Aerospace & Defense Agriculture Chemicals & Materials Architecture Consumer Goods Blogs About Contact Home Automotive & Transportation SUV Market SUV Market Size, Share, Growth, and Industry Analysis, By Types (Diesel, Petrol, Others) , Applications (Remote areas, Recreation, Motorsport) and Regional Insights and Forecast to 2033 Request a FREE Sample PDF Buy Now Last Updated: June 30 , 2025 Base Year: 2024 Historical Data: 2020-2023 No of Pages: 109 SKU ID: 25204558 Request a FREE Sample PDF Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Request a FREE Sample PDF SUV Market Size The global SUV market size was valued at USD 2.97 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 3.04 billion in 2025, eventually expanding to USD 3.71 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 2.5% from 2025 to 2033.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/suv-market-108263', 'content': 'SUV Market Size, Trends | Growth [2033] SUV Market Industries Information & Technology Healthcare Machinery & Equipment Automotive & Transportation Food & Beverages Energy & Power Aerospace & Defense Agriculture Chemicals & Materials Architecture Consumer Goods Blogs About Contact Home Automotive & Transportation SUV Market SUV Market Size, Share, Growth, and Industry Analysis, By Types (Diesel, Petrol, Others) , Applications (Remote areas, Recreation, Motorsport) and Regional Insights and Forecast to 2033 Request a FREE Sample PDF Buy Now Last Updated: June 30 , 2025 Base Year: 2024 Historical Data: 2020-2023 No of Pages: 109 SKU ID: 25204558 Request a FREE Sample PDF Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Request a FREE Sample PDF SUV Market Size The global SUV market size was valued at USD 2.97 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 3.04 billion in 2025, eventually expanding to USD 3.71 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 2.5% from 2025 to 2033.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

AUTO PUNDITZ January 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Feb 20 5 min read In this January 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Gunning For The 2nd Spot While their usual sales heroes like the Scorpio and XUV700 have been performing well for several years now, the 3XO along with some help from Thar Roxx, Mahindra are shaking up the auto industry. And this behaviour isnt going to change. With the BE6 and XEV 9e, they have conveyed that theyre not just here to sell electric cars. Theyre here to set new benchmarks in terms of value and features. The pricing of these 2 EVs has shaken up not just carmakers like Hyundai, Tata and Maruti but also the Chinese/Chinese-owned carmakers like MG and BYD are feeling the sting. So much so that MG jacked up the prices of the ZS while leaving the base price unchanged. On top of that, they are willing to give away discounts of up to ~Rs. 2.50 lakh on the base trim, which is the highest we have ever seen. So, the price hike was just a smoke screen when in reality, they are feeling the pinch from Mahindras BE6 and the Tata Curvv EV. We were counting on having a price war in the EV space in the 2025 - 28 period but a non-Chinese carmaker would take the first swing that, we didnt expect. The first swing will come from an Indian carmaker, that didnt just come as a surprise, it came as a shock. Its not this move that should scare the Chinese and even other carmakers. Its their attitude and hunger for greater market share, which should scare their rivals. The EV strategy suggests that this time around, they arent just going for one more bite out of the pie. They want the whole pie to themselves. Of course, it's not going to be easy but it looks like they are gunning for it anyway. That should make Hyundai very worried as they have maintained their hold on the 2nd spot in the Indian car market for God knows how long. Carmaker Jan 2025 Jan 2024 YoY% 12M Avg Maruti 1,73,599 1,66,802 +4.07% 1,46,850 Hyundai 54,003 57,013 -5.28% 50,193 Mahindra 50,659 43,068 +17.63% 44,950 Tata 48,075 53,635 -10.37% 46,409 Compared to Jan 2024, Mahindra and Maruti have gained market share while Hyundai and Tata have lost. Mahindra's YoY gains of 17.63% come across as enormous compared to Marutis. However, the YoY decline of 10.37% in Tatas sales suggests that they have graduated from 4th spot to 3rd. Since Hyundai also appear to have suffered some YoY decline in Jan 2025, its not too far-fetched to imagine that once Mahindra are feeling secure in the 3rd spot, they will be preparing to displace Hyundai from the 2nd spot. In average sales, though, Hyundai remain firmly in the 2nd spot while Tata in 3rd spot. Mahindra are in the 4th spot with an average shortage of 1459 every month. We expect them to easily make up this gap and create a larger gap for Tata to crawl in this calendar year. For 2025, Tata are also lining up the Sierra petrol/diesel and Sierra EV along with the Harrier EV. Mahindra are likely to bring a 3-row electric car (similar t\", 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://gaadiwaadi.com/9000-units-of-mahindra-xuv-3xo-sold-in-august-2024-80-growth/', 'content': 'Cars News Bikes News Auto Industry News Mod Job Gaadiwaadi.com Latest Car & Bike News CARS NEWS BIKES NEWS AUTO INDUSTRY NEWS MOD JOB Home Cars News 9,000 Units Of Mahindra XUV 3XO Sold In August 2024, 80% Growth By Surendhar M - September 7, 2024 Pic Source: Hari Haran Mahindra XUV 3XO posted 9,000 units in the month of August 2024 as against 4,992 units with a YoY sales growth of 80 per cent In late May, M&M marked the first day of deliveries for the XUV 3XO by handing over 1,500 units to customers nationwide. The response was remarkable, as the automaker received over 50,000 bookings within just an hour of opening reservations. Interestingly, nearly 70 per cent of the bookings were for the petrol variants of this compact SUV. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has been a key contributor to the brands sales figures since its debut. In its first month on sale in May 2024, 10,000 units were dispatched. The compact SUV has maintained this momentum over the following months, with August 2024 seeing a strong performance of 9,000 units, nearly doubling the 4,992 units sold in the same month last year. This resulted in a significant year-on-year sales growth of 80 per cent for the Mahindra XUV 3XO. However, MoM figures showed a 10 per cent decline, as 10,000 units were sold in July 2024. The XUV 3XO is available in nine trim levels namely MX1, MX2, MX2 Pro, MX3, MX3 Pro, AX5, AX5 Luxury, AX7, and AX7 Luxury. Although the MX3 Pro offers excellent value for money, the feature-packed AX5 and AX5 Luxury variants remain popular choices among buyers. Also Read:Mahindra XUV 3XO Most Detailed Review & Mileage Test Consumers tend to favour the petrol variants over the diesel versions of the Mahindra XUV 3XO, primarily due to the notable price gap between the two fuel options. The compact SUV is offered with three engine choices: a 1.2L petrol, a 1.2L direct injection petrol and a 1.5L diesel. The 1.2L petrol engine produces 115 PS and 200 Nm of torque while the more powerful 1.2L DI variant delivers 130 PS and 250 Nm of torque. The 1.5L four-cylinder diesel engine in the Mahindra XUV 3XO generates 117 PS and 300 Nm of torque. Transmission options include a six-speed manual, a six-speed AMT and a six-speed TC. Compared to its predecessor, the rebranded XUV 3XO boasts a larger boot, enhancing its practicality.

AUTO PUNDITZ January 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Feb 20 5 min read In this January 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Gunning For The 2nd Spot While their usual sales heroes like the Scorpio and XUV700 have been performing well for several years now, the 3XO along with some help from Thar Roxx, Mahindra are shaking up the auto industry. And this behaviour isnt going to change. With the BE6 and XEV 9e, they have conveyed that theyre not just here to sell electric cars. Theyre here to set new benchmarks in terms of value and features. The pricing of these 2 EVs has shaken up not just carmakers like Hyundai, Tata and Maruti but also the Chinese/Chinese-owned carmakers like MG and BYD are feeling the sting. So much so that MG jacked up the prices of the ZS while leaving the base price unchanged. On top of that, they are willing to give away discounts of up to ~Rs. 2.50 lakh on the base trim, which is the highest we have ever seen. So, the price hike was just a smoke screen when in reality, they are feeling the pinch from Mahindras BE6 and the Tata Curvv EV. We were counting on having a price war in the EV space in the 2025 - 28 period but a non-Chinese carmaker would take the first swing that, we didnt expect. The first swing will come from an Indian carmaker, that didnt just come as a surprise, it came as a shock. Its not this move that should scare the Chinese and even other carmakers. Its their attitude and hunger for greater market share, which should scare their rivals. The EV strategy suggests that this time around, they arent just going for one more bite out of the pie. They want the whole pie to themselves. Of course, it's not going to be easy but it looks like they are gunning for it anyway. That should make Hyundai very worried as they have maintained their hold on the 2nd spot in the Indian car market for God knows how long. Carmaker Jan 2025 Jan 2024 YoY% 12M Avg Maruti 1,73,599 1,66,802 +4.07% 1,46,850 Hyundai 54,003 57,013 -5.28% 50,193 Mahindra 50,659 43,068 +17.63% 44,950 Tata 48,075 53,635 -10.37% 46,409 Compared to Jan 2024, Mahindra and Maruti have gained market share while Hyundai and Tata have lost. Mahindra's YoY gains of 17.63% come across as enormous compared to Marutis. However, the YoY decline of 10.37% in Tatas sales suggests that they have graduated from 4th spot to 3rd. Since Hyundai also appear to have suffered some YoY decline in Jan 2025, its not too far-fetched to imagine that once Mahindra are feeling secure in the 3rd spot, they will be preparing to displace Hyundai from the 2nd spot. In average sales, though, Hyundai remain firmly in the 2nd spot while Tata in 3rd spot. Mahindra are in the 4th spot with an average shortage of 1459 every month. We expect them to easily make up this gap and create a larger gap for Tata to crawl in this calendar year. For 2025, Tata are also lining up the Sierra petrol/diesel and Sierra EV along with the Harrier EV. Mahindra are likely to bring a 3-row electric car (similar t\", 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://gaadiwaadi.com/9000-units-of-mahindra-xuv-3xo-sold-in-august-2024-80-growth/', 'content': 'Cars News Bikes News Auto Industry News Mod Job Gaadiwaadi.com Latest Car & Bike News CARS NEWS BIKES NEWS AUTO INDUSTRY NEWS MOD JOB Home Cars News 9,000 Units Of Mahindra XUV 3XO Sold In August 2024, 80% Growth By Surendhar M - September 7, 2024 Pic Source: Hari Haran Mahindra XUV 3XO posted 9,000 units in the month of August 2024 as against 4,992 units with a YoY sales growth of 80 per cent In late May, M&M marked the first day of deliveries for the XUV 3XO by handing over 1,500 units to customers nationwide. The response was remarkable, as the automaker received over 50,000 bookings within just an hour of opening reservations. Interestingly, nearly 70 per cent of the bookings were for the petrol variants of this compact SUV. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has been a key contributor to the brands sales figures since its debut. In its first month on sale in May 2024, 10,000 units were dispatched. The compact SUV has maintained this momentum over the following months, with August 2024 seeing a strong performance of 9,000 units, nearly doubling the 4,992 units sold in the same month last year. This resulted in a significant year-on-year sales growth of 80 per cent for the Mahindra XUV 3XO. However, MoM figures showed a 10 per cent decline, as 10,000 units were sold in July 2024. The XUV 3XO is available in nine trim levels namely MX1, MX2, MX2 Pro, MX3, MX3 Pro, AX5, AX5 Luxury, AX7, and AX7 Luxury. Although the MX3 Pro offers excellent value for money, the feature-packed AX5 and AX5 Luxury variants remain popular choices among buyers. Also Read:Mahindra XUV 3XO Most Detailed Review & Mileage Test Consumers tend to favour the petrol variants over the diesel versions of the Mahindra XUV 3XO, primarily due to the notable price gap between the two fuel options. The compact SUV is offered with three engine choices: a 1.2L petrol, a 1.2L direct injection petrol and a 1.5L diesel. The 1.2L petrol engine produces 115 PS and 200 Nm of torque while the more powerful 1.2L DI variant delivers 130 PS and 250 Nm of torque. The 1.5L four-cylinder diesel engine in the Mahindra XUV 3XO generates 117 PS and 300 Nm of torque. Transmission options include a six-speed manual, a six-speed AMT and a six-speed TC. Compared to its predecessor, the rebranded XUV 3XO boasts a larger boot, enhancing its practicality.
