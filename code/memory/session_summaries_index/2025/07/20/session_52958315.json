The SUV market is projected to reach 53 million units by 2030 from 41 million units in 2024, at a CAGR of 4.4%. The report will help the market leaders/new entrants in this market with information on the closest approximations of the sales numbers for the SUVs and their subsegments. This report will help stakeholders understand the competitive landscape and gain more insights to position their businesses better and to plan suitable go-to-market strategies. The report also helps stakeholders understand the pulse of the market and provides them with information on key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities. The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies. Further, the introduction of autonomous SUVs with enhanced safety features and higher level of automation is shifting the trends in the SUV market. Moreover, OEMs are focused on reducing the production cost of the vehicle by standadizing the platform technology and planning & developing unique platforms for all the SUVs under their brand. Furthermore, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) SUVs can be a major break-through in the SUVs market. Although the FCEV technology is still in the initial stages, planned research & development is carried out and can become a next major factor in the overall automotive industry, SUVs included. In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s. Autonomous SUVs are anticipated to witness growth Autonomous SUVs are projected to grow significantly during the forecast due to the rising demand for safety, comfort, and driving convenience features.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles.

At 551,487 SUVs sold and robust 20% year-on-year growth (FY2024: 459,877 units), FY2025 was a bumper fiscal year for the company.

At 551,487 SUVs sold and robust 20% year-on-year growth (FY2024: 459,877 units), FY2025 was a bumper fiscal year for the company.

AUTO PUNDITZ February 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Mar 20 4 min read In this February 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Mission Accomplished! Mahindra have finally managed to secure the 2nd spot for the first time ever. While Tata Motors have enjoyed the 2nd position a few times, this is an achievement for Mahindra. With a 13.24% market share in Feb 2025, Mahindra were only behind Maruti Suzuki while Hyundai and Tata secured 12.54% and 12.20% market share. We shouldnt expect anyone to beat Maruti Suzuki any time soon. So, 2nd spot is as high as any other carmaker can go and thats where well see Hyundai, Tata and Mahindra fighting it out in the coming months. They usually say once a flop, always a flop. But Mahindra showed the industry how they can turn around a flop product and turn it into a success. The XUV 300 did well for itself but it was not a sales success in its segment where segment leaders routinely hit close to 15,000 dispatches every month. It looked like it was impossible to turn its fate around but Mahindra did exactly that, that too in a much too crowded market. It has managed to make space for itself as it continues with a typical monthly dispatch figure of 7,000 - 9,000 averaging at 8,256. The fact that they achieved this with what the industry calls a mid-life update makes it all the more special. They not only gave it a new yet recognizable name, they revamped its exterior and interior design, revised the variant lineup, feature distribution and added a few segment first features to earn buyers respect. But what helped it the most was its value for money pricing. From there, like one sledgehammer hit after another, they brought out the new age electric cars and that finally got them enough volumes to beat Hyundai and attain 2nd place in Feb 2025. If the journey to get this far was tough, we can expect the path forward to be tougher for Mahindra. Tata & Hyundai are still not too far behind. Its going to be interesting to see the 3 manufacturers battling it out to grab the 2nd spot going forward until one of them leaves the other two so far behind that they instead focus on staying on the podium instead.

The launch of the XUV 3XO (above right) in April 2024 has accelerated sales. The 85,990 units sold in the first 10 months of FY2025 are up 80% YoY. At this pace, the 3XO will go on to hit the 100,000-units sales mark in FY2025.

The Mahindra compact SUV went on to hit 200,000 sales in May 2023 , 47 months after launch. The 300,000 milestone came up 16 months later in early October 2024. Given the current rapid pace of sales, the 400,000 sales milestone should be achieved in even fewer months. At present, the 3XO is 65,747 units away from that big number and should hit it around August-September 2025. What is helping accelerate sales for this SUV is the gains coming from M&Ms heightened focus on safety. In mid-November 2024, the XUV 3XO, along with the Thar Roxx and XUV400, aced the Bharat NCAP crash test .

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO. While deliveries begin on May 26 it may be time before you get your hands on one if youre not one of those 50,000 people. Cons - Lack of AT with Diesel Adding the new 6-speed automatic gearbox in the mix was a good move by Mahindra.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO - 5 Positives 1) Spacious Cabin & Comfortable Ride Quality The biggest USP of the 3XO is its uber-spacious cabin. The light colour interiors offer a decent space for a family of 5 people. The front seats offer good cushioning while the rear seat design is also sought for long-distance comfort. Three passengers can easily sit abreast at the rear seat. Moreover, there are plenty of storage spaces all around the cabin for convenience. Adding to this is the re-tuned suspension of the XUV 3XO that offers a supple ride quality. Bumps, undulations, and cracks on the road are soaked well by its suspension. Moreover, this highway stability and ride is also confidence-inspiring. 2) Strong Engine Performance & Smooth AT Gearbox Ever since its launch, the XUV300 has been loved by owners and enthusiasts for its strong engine performance. This fact remains unchanged on the new 3XO as well. Available in three engine options, the practicality and power are well shared across its range of variants. Mahindra offers two turbo-petrol engine options and a turbo-diesel engine to choose from. All of these offer a torquey and grunt-rich performance. Additionally, the diesel engine is loved for its fuel-efficient nature and it has proven to be a typical highway cruiser. To improve the engine driving experience, the new 3XO now comes with the option of a 6-speed AISIN-sourced torque converter auto gearbox. It is a very smooth unit that also delivers good fuel economy. Sadly, it is only available on the 1.2L TGDi petrol engine. 3) Strong Build Quality & Top-Notch Safety The overall build quality and fit-finish of the 3XO are superb. There are no panel gaps or inconsistencies in the metal or plastic quality. The fitment of panels and plastic elements like the bumpers is spot-on. Also, the interior quality is no less than a German car. The top-notch material used for leather and stitching with the best threads along with good quality plastic used all around the cabin, give a cumulative feel of a premium car. The outgoing XUV300 was a GNCAP 5-star crash test rating car. It was one of the safest SUVs in India. The newer model has uplifted this game one step above. For the top variants, the XUV 3XO comes equipped with ADAS Level 2 features. These include active front collision warning and autonomous assist features like\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/91W-Featured-Image-1-3.png?w=1920&q=65', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'border-2 border-white ring-2 ring-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-18.18.32-1024x576.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Interior', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120415', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-17.39.17-1024x577.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120404', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'title': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.drivespark.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-driving-impressions-specs-features-images-047267.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/news-story/2c3dc522990605e7bc1a0ab1acf91177', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/expert-reviews/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

The SUV market is projected to reach 53 million units by 2030 from 41 million units in 2024, at a CAGR of 4.4%. The report will help the market leaders/new entrants in this market with information on the closest approximations of the sales numbers for the SUVs and their subsegments. This report will help stakeholders understand the competitive landscape and gain more insights to position their businesses better and to plan suitable go-to-market strategies. The report also helps stakeholders understand the pulse of the market and provides them with information on key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities. The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies. Further, the introduction of autonomous SUVs with enhanced safety features and higher level of automation is shifting the trends in the SUV market. Moreover, OEMs are focused on reducing the production cost of the vehicle by standadizing the platform technology and planning & developing unique platforms for all the SUVs under their brand. Furthermore, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) SUVs can be a major break-through in the SUVs market. Although the FCEV technology is still in the initial stages, planned research & development is carried out and can become a next major factor in the overall automotive industry, SUVs included. In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s. Autonomous SUVs are anticipated to witness growth Autonomous SUVs are projected to grow significantly during the forecast due to the rising demand for safety, comfort, and driving convenience features.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry.

The model also faced a considerable MoM drop of 18.43%, with 991 fewer units sold compared to June 2024s 5,376 units.

The company must continue to innovate and adapt its strategies to capitalize on its successes and address the areas where performance is lagging.

At 551,487 SUVs sold and robust 20% year-on-year growth (FY2024: 459,877 units), FY2025 was a bumper fiscal year for the company. With an all-SUV portfolio, M&M has, since FY2022 when it sold 225,895 units, successfully surfed the wave of surging demand for most of its models. In FY2025, in terms of model-wise share of sales, the Scorpio twins and the 3XO compact SUV achieved their best-ever fiscal year numbers, together contributing 48% of the company's best-ever fiscal wholesales.

The compact SUV sold 100,923 units in FY2025, up by a massive 84% YoY (FY2024: 54,726 units) this is an additional 46,197 units and the highest for any Mahindra SUV in FY2025.

AUTO PUNDITZ February 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Mar 20 4 min read In this February 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Mission Accomplished! Mahindra have finally managed to secure the 2nd spot for the first time ever. While Tata Motors have enjoyed the 2nd position a few times, this is an achievement for Mahindra. With a 13.24% market share in Feb 2025, Mahindra were only behind Maruti Suzuki while Hyundai and Tata secured 12.54% and 12.20% market share. We shouldnt expect anyone to beat Maruti Suzuki any time soon. So, 2nd spot is as high as any other carmaker can go and thats where well see Hyundai, Tata and Mahindra fighting it out in the coming months. They usually say once a flop, always a flop. But Mahindra showed the industry how they can turn around a flop product and turn it into a success. The XUV 300 did well for itself but it was not a sales success in its segment where segment leaders routinely hit close to 15,000 dispatches every month. It looked like it was impossible to turn its fate around but Mahindra did exactly that, that too in a much too crowded market. It has managed to make space for itself as it continues with a typical monthly dispatch figure of 7,000 - 9,000 averaging at 8,256. The fact that they achieved this with what the industry calls a mid-life update makes it all the more special. They not only gave it a new yet recognizable name, they revamped its exterior and interior design, revised the variant lineup, feature distribution and added a few segment first features to earn buyers respect. But what helped it the most was its value for money pricing. From there, like one sledgehammer hit after another, they brought out the new age electric cars and that finally got them enough volumes to beat Hyundai and attain 2nd place in Feb 2025. If the journey to get this far was tough, we can expect the path forward to be tougher for Mahindra. Tata & Hyundai are still not too far behind. Its going to be interesting to see the 3 manufacturers battling it out to grab the 2nd spot going forward until one of them leaves the other two so far behind that they instead focus on staying on the podium instead.

AUTO PUNDITZ February 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Mar 20 4 min read In this February 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Mission Accomplished! Mahindra have finally managed to secure the 2nd spot for the first time ever. While Tata Motors have enjoyed the 2nd position a few times, this is an achievement for Mahindra. With a 13.24% market share in Feb 2025, Mahindra were only behind Maruti Suzuki while Hyundai and Tata secured 12.54% and 12.20% market share. We shouldnt expect anyone to beat Maruti Suzuki any time soon. So, 2nd spot is as high as any other carmaker can go and thats where well see Hyundai, Tata and Mahindra fighting it out in the coming months. They usually say once a flop, always a flop. But Mahindra showed the industry how they can turn around a flop product and turn it into a success. The XUV 300 did well for itself but it was not a sales success in its segment where segment leaders routinely hit close to 15,000 dispatches every month. It looked like it was impossible to turn its fate around but Mahindra did exactly that, that too in a much too crowded market. It has managed to make space for itself as it continues with a typical monthly dispatch figure of 7,000 - 9,000 averaging at 8,256. The fact that they achieved this with what the industry calls a mid-life update makes it all the more special. They not only gave it a new yet recognizable name, they revamped its exterior and interior design, revised the variant lineup, feature distribution and added a few segment first features to earn buyers respect. But what helped it the most was its value for money pricing. From there, like one sledgehammer hit after another, they brought out the new age electric cars and that finally got them enough volumes to beat Hyundai and attain 2nd place in Feb 2025. If the journey to get this far was tough, we can expect the path forward to be tougher for Mahindra. Tata & Hyundai are still not too far behind. Its going to be interesting to see the 3 manufacturers battling it out to grab the 2nd spot going forward until one of them leaves the other two so far behind that they instead focus on staying on the podium instead.

Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO. While deliveries begin on May 26 it may be time before you get your hands on one if youre not one of those 50,000 people. Cons - Lack of AT with Diesel Adding the new 6-speed automatic gearbox in the mix was a good move by Mahindra.

Auto Industry Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compelling sub-compact SUV with segment-leading safety, powerful engines and new style in the market. NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link The sub-compact SUV in India witnesseda huge disruption with the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in April 2024. This heavily redesigned XUV300 successor has created a lot of buzz in the market, promising to fix the shortcomings of the previous model and introduce segment-first features. Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO - 5 Positives 1) Spacious Cabin & Comfortable Ride Quality The biggest USP of the 3XO is its uber-spacious cabin. The light colour interiors offer a decent space for a family of 5 people. The front seats offer good cushioning while the rear seat design is also sought for long-distance comfort. Three passengers can easily sit abreast at the rear seat. Moreover, there are plenty of storage spaces all around the cabin for convenience. Adding to this is the re-tuned suspension of the XUV 3XO that offers a supple ride quality. Bumps, undulations, and cracks on the road are soaked well by its suspension. Moreover, this highway stability and ride is also confidence-inspiring. 2) Strong Engine Performance & Smooth AT Gearbox Ever since its launch, the XUV300 has been loved by owners and enthusiasts for its strong engine performance. This fact remains unchanged on the new 3XO as well. Available in three engine options, the practicality and power are well shared across its range of variants. Mahindra offers two turbo-petrol engine options and a turbo-diesel engine to choose from. All of these offer a torquey and grunt-rich performance. Additionally, the diesel engine is loved for its fuel-efficient nature and it has proven to be a typical highway cruiser. To improve the engine driving experience, the new 3XO now comes with the option of a 6-speed AISIN-sourced torque converter auto gearbox. It is a very smooth unit that also delivers good fuel economy. Sadly, it is only available on the 1.2L TGDi petrol engine. 3) Strong Build Quality & Top-Notch Safety The overall build quality and fit-finish of the 3XO are superb. There are no panel gaps or inconsistencies in the metal or plastic quality. The fitment of panels and plastic elements like the bumpers is spot-on. Also, the interior quality is no less than a German car. The top-notch material used for leather and stitching with the best threads along with good quality plastic used all around the cabin, give a cumulative feel of a premium car. The outgoing XUV300 was a GNCAP 5-star crash test rating car. It was one of the safest SUVs in India. The newer model has uplifted this game one step above. For the top variants, the XUV 3XO comes equipped with ADAS Level 2 features. These include active front collision warning and autonomous assist features like\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/91W-Featured-Image-1-3.png?w=1920&q=65', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'border-2 border-white ring-2 ring-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-18.18.32-1024x576.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Interior', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120415', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-17.39.17-1024x577.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120404', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'title': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.drivespark.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-driving-impressions-specs-features-images-047267.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/news-story/2c3dc522990605e7bc1a0ab1acf91177', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/expert-reviews/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

But is it a good buy? Contents The XUV 3XO is not a new-gen model but an extensive facelift. And its just not on the design front, but also the offerings. Mahindra received more than 50,000 bookings within an hour, so things have started on a positive note. So should you ride the wave and buy it? Well, we tell you both sides of the story. Pro - Powertrain Options Carried over from the XUV300, the XUV 3XO comes with a variety of powertrain options. You have a choice of a turbo-petrol engine in two states of tune and a diesel engine as well. You also get the option of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed AMT and the new Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic. Powertrain Turbo-Petrol (TCMPFi) Turbo-Petrol (TGDi) Diesel Displacement 1197 cc 1197 cc 1497 cc Max Power 110 bhp @ 5000 rpm 129 bhp @ 5000 rpm 115 bhp @ 3750 rpm Peak Torque 200 Nm @ 1500-3500 rpm 230 Nm @ 1500-3750 rpm 300 Nm @ 1500-2500 rpm Transmission 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AT 6-Speed MT/ 6-Speed AMT Fuel efficiency 18.89 kmpl (MT)/ 17.96 kmpl (AT) 20.1 kmpl (MT)/ 18.2 kmpl (AT) 20.6 kmpl (MT)/ 21.2 kmpl (AMT) Surprisingly, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine with the higher state of tune is more frugal. But the diesel is unbeatable in terms of fuel efficiency as with the AMT it returns 21.2 kmpl. Pro - Ride Quality Mahindra has improved the already fantastic suspension from the XUV 300 with this facelift. The result is a steady ride. On big bumps, it is very poised and even smaller bumps are dealt with ease. Pro - Safety Features Theres a plethora of safety features on offer with the XUV 3XO. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all seats and so many more safety features as standard. And then, the icing on the cake is that it's the first subcompact SUV with level 2 ADAS. Lets wait and watch how it performs at the Global NCAP crash tests. Pro - Prices Mahindra knocked it out of the park with the XUV 3XO. Only the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a lower starting price than the Mahindra. The top-end price of the XUV 3XO may be higher than its rivals but there is so much on offer here. Prices Mahindra XUV 3XO Kia Sonet Hyundai Venue Tata Nexon Maruti Suzuki Brezza Nissan Magnite Renault Kiger Petrol MT NA 7.99 - 10 lakh 7.94 - 11.05 lakh NA 8.34 - 12.58 lakh 6 9.03 lakh 6 8.60 lakh Petrol AT NA NA NA NA 11.10 - 13.98 lakh 7.10 - 9.53 lakh 6.60 - 8.96 lakh Turbo-Petrol MT 7.49 - 13.99 lakh 10.56 - 13.50 lakh 10 - 12.81 lakh 8.15 - 13.60 lakh NA 9.30 10 lakh 9.19 9.80 lakh Turbo-Petrol AT 9.99 - 15.49 lakh 12.36 - 14.75 lakh 11.86 - 13.48 lakh 10 - 14.80 lakh NA 10.30 - 11.23 lakh 9.84 - 10.66 lakh Diesel MT 9.99 - 14.99 lakh 9.80 - 14.50 lakh 10.71 - 13.44 lakh 11.10 - 15 lakh NA NA NA Diesel AT 11.69 - 14.49 lakh 13.10 - 15.75 lakh NA 11.80 - 15.60 lakh NA NA NA Pro - Features The XUV 3XO is packed to the brim with features. A 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity is available on all but the base trim, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a Harman Kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof, ADAS and so much more. Now lets have a look at where the XUV 3XO lacks. Cons - Waiting Period A long waiting period is a problem not just with the XUV 3XO but with most of Mahindras lineup in India. Mahindra currently has an order backlog of around 2 lakh 20 thousand units, which includes 50,000 units of the XUV 3XO. While deliveries begin on May 26 it may be time before you get your hands on one if youre not one of those 50,000 people.

Auto Industry Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 5-Star Safety Meets Bold New Style The Mahindra XUV 3XO is a compelling sub-compact SUV with segment-leading safety, powerful engines and new style in the market. NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 NITISH MAJUMDER June 5, 2025 Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link The sub-compact SUV in India witnesseda huge disruption with the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO in April 2024. This heavily redesigned XUV300 successor has created a lot of buzz in the market, promising to fix the shortcomings of the previous model and introduce segment-first features. Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications Specification Details Price Range Rs. 7.99 15.80 Lakh (ex-showroom) Engine Options 1.2L Turbo Petrol (110 bhp), 1.2L TGDi (129 bhp), 1.5L Diesel (115 bhp) Transmission 6-speed Manual, 6-speed Automatic, 6-speed AMT Safety Rating 5-star BNCAP Mileage 17.96-21.2 kmpl (ARAI) Boot Space 295 liters Fuel Tank 42 liters Ground Clearance 201 mm Wheelbase 2600 mm Seating Capacity 5 passengers Engine and Variants The XUV 3XO continues with the same set of engines seen on theolder version, with three options. The base 1.2-litre turbo petrol makes 110 bhp and 200 Nm, good enough for city driving with decent fuel efficiency of around 17-19 kmpl. The highlight is new 1.2-litreTGDi direct injection petrol, good 129 bhp and 230 Nm. Theres adequate mid-rangepunch in this engine and highway overtaking is a breeze. The new torque converter automatic transmission works well with both petrol engines, smoother than the jerky AMT. For diesel lovers, the 1.5-litre turbo diesel continues to be the best in class with 300 Nm torque. The manual transmission is seamless, but the AMT is reluctant in lower gears, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Design and Styling Updates Mahindra has completely redesigned the XUV 3XOs exterior. The new front face features vertically arranged headlamps with C-shaped LED DRLs, making itlook related to the XUV700. The wide grille has diamond-shaped detailing and connected LED tail-lamps. The side profile has chunky cladding and 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels on higher variants. But the styling is divisive, some find it bold and fresh while others think its too dramatic for the segment. Interior Space and Features The cabin is a big upgrade over the previous model. Mahindra has given the XUV 3XO a free-standing 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and matching digital instrument cluster, same as the XUV700. Space is excellent, with class-leading rear legroom for 5 adults. The dashboard has soft-touch materials and premium finishes on higher variants and plenty of storage spaces for practicality. Key Features: Panoramic sunroof (segment-first) Dual-zone automatic climate control 360-degree camera system Electronic parking brake with auto-hold Level 2 ADAS on top variants Safety and Build The XUV 3XOs biggest achievement is its 5-star BNCAP rating, making it one of the safest in the segment. All variants come with six airbags, all-wheel disc brakes and comprehensive safety features like ABS, EBD and ESP. Higher variants get advanced driver assistance features like forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. The build quality is robust and users often praise it as tank-like.

Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO - 5 Positives 1) Spacious Cabin & Comfortable Ride Quality The biggest USP of the 3XO is its uber-spacious cabin. The light colour interiors offer a decent space for a family of 5 people. The front seats offer good cushioning while the rear seat design is also sought for long-distance comfort. Three passengers can easily sit abreast at the rear seat. Moreover, there are plenty of storage spaces all around the cabin for convenience. Adding to this is the re-tuned suspension of the XUV 3XO that offers a supple ride quality. Bumps, undulations, and cracks on the road are soaked well by its suspension. Moreover, this highway stability and ride is also confidence-inspiring. 2) Strong Engine Performance & Smooth AT Gearbox Ever since its launch, the XUV300 has been loved by owners and enthusiasts for its strong engine performance. This fact remains unchanged on the new 3XO as well. Available in three engine options, the practicality and power are well shared across its range of variants. Mahindra offers two turbo-petrol engine options and a turbo-diesel engine to choose from. All of these offer a torquey and grunt-rich performance. Additionally, the diesel engine is loved for its fuel-efficient nature and it has proven to be a typical highway cruiser. To improve the engine driving experience, the new 3XO now comes with the option of a 6-speed AISIN-sourced torque converter auto gearbox. It is a very smooth unit that also delivers good fuel economy. Sadly, it is only available on the 1.2L TGDi petrol engine. 3) Strong Build Quality & Top-Notch Safety The overall build quality and fit-finish of the 3XO are superb. There are no panel gaps or inconsistencies in the metal or plastic quality. The fitment of panels and plastic elements like the bumpers is spot-on. Also, the interior quality is no less than a German car. The top-notch material used for leather and stitching with the best threads along with good quality plastic used all around the cabin, give a cumulative feel of a premium car. The outgoing XUV300 was a GNCAP 5-star crash test rating car. It was one of the safest SUVs in India. The newer model has uplifted this game one step above. For the top variants, the XUV 3XO comes equipped with ADAS Level 2 features. These include active front collision warning and autonomous assist features like\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/91W-Featured-Image-1-3.png?w=1920&q=65', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'border-2 border-white ring-2 ring-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-18.18.32-1024x576.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Interior', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120415', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-17.39.17-1024x577.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120404', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'title': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.drivespark.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-driving-impressions-specs-features-images-047267.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/review-mahindra-xuv-3xo/news-story/2c3dc522990605e7bc1a0ab1acf91177', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.spinny.com/cars/mahindra/xuv-3xo/expert-reviews/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",
