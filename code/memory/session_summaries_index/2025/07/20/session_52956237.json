SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.futuredatastats.com/suv-market', 'content': 'SUV Market Size & Industry Growth 2030 close search About Us Press Releases Report Store Company Profiles Contact Us shopping_cart 0 menu home Report Store SUV Market SUV Market Size, Share, Trends & Competitive Analysis By Type: Compact SUVs, Mid-Size SUVs, Full-Size SUVs, Luxury SUVs, Electric SUVs, Hybrid SUVs By Fuel Type:, Gasoline SUVs, Diesel SUVs, Electric SUVs, Hybrid SUVs By Drivetrain: By Seating Capacity: By Application: Personal Use SUVs, Commercial Use SUVs, Off-Road SUVs By Distribution Channel: By Regions, and Industry Forecast, Global Report 2025-2033 Report ID: FDS1415 Forecast Period: 2025 - 2033 No. of Pages: 150+ Industry: Automotive and Transportation Ask any Question Request Customization Ask for Discount Enquiry before Buying Request Sample Description Table of Contents Segmentation Why Buy This Report Methodology Industry Development The global SUV Market size was valued at USD 1.36 Trillion in 2024 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% during the forecast period, reaching a value of USD 2.2 Trillion by 2032.

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,095 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://autotorque.in/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-features-and-performance/', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: A Comprehensive Analysis of Features and Performance - Auto Torque Skip to content Auto Torque New Car and Bike's News Home Latest News Latest Cars Latest Bikes Electric Vehicles (EVs) Hybrid Cars Auto Torque New Car and Bike's News || Latest News || Latest Cars || Latest Bikes || Electric Vehicles (EVs) || Hybrid Cars || Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: A Comprehensive Analysis of Features and Performance Leave a Comment / By Auto Torque / 9 August 2024 Mahindra has unleashed the XUV 3XO, a revamped version of the XUV300, aimed at dominating the compact SUV segment.

Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Gunning For The 2nd Spot While their usual sales heroes like the Scorpio and XUV700 have been performing well for several years now, the 3XO along with some help from Thar Roxx, Mahindra are shaking up the auto industry. And this behaviour isnt going to change. With the BE6 and XEV 9e, they have conveyed that theyre not just here to sell electric cars. Theyre here to set new benchmarks in terms of value and features. The pricing of these 2 EVs has shaken up not just carmakers like Hyundai, Tata and Maruti but also the Chinese/Chinese-owned carmakers like MG and BYD are feeling the sting. So much so that MG jacked up the prices of the ZS while leaving the base price unchanged. On top of that, they are willing to give away discounts of up to ~Rs. 2.50 lakh on the base trim, which is the highest we have ever seen. So, the price hike was just a smoke screen when in reality, they are feeling the pinch from Mahindras BE6 and the Tata Curvv EV. We were counting on having a price war in the EV space in the 2025 - 28 period but a non-Chinese carmaker would take the first swing that, we didnt expect. The first swing will come from an Indian carmaker, that didnt just come as a surprise, it came as a shock. Its not this move that should scare the Chinese and even other carmakers. Its their attitude and hunger for greater market share, which should scare their rivals. The EV strategy suggests that this time around, they arent just going for one more bite out of the pie. They want the whole pie to themselves. Of course, it's not going to be easy but it looks like they are gunning for it anyway. That should make Hyundai very worried as they have maintained their hold on the 2nd spot in the Indian car market for God knows how long. Carmaker Jan 2025 Jan 2024 YoY% 12M Avg Maruti 1,73,599 1,66,802 +4.07% 1,46,850 Hyundai 54,003 57,013 -5.28% 50,193 Mahindra 50,659 43,068 +17.63% 44,950 Tata 48,075 53,635 -10.37% 46,409 Compared to Jan 2024, Mahindra and Maruti have gained market share while Hyundai and Tata have lost. Mahindra's YoY gains of 17.63% come across as enormous compared to Marutis. However, the YoY decline of 10.37% in Tatas sales suggests that they have graduated from 4th spot to 3rd. Since Hyundai also appear to have suffered some YoY decline in Jan 2025, its not too far-fetched to imagine that once Mahindra are feeling secure in the 3rd spot, they will be preparing to displace Hyundai from the 2nd spot. In average sales, though, Hyundai remain firmly in the 2nd spot while Tata in 3rd spot. Mahindra are in the 4th spot with an average shortage of 1459 every month. We expect them to easily make up this gap and create a larger gap for Tata to crawl in this calendar year. For 2025, Tata are also lining up the Sierra petrol/diesel and Sierra EV along with the Harrier EV. Mahindra are likely to bring a 3-row electric car (similar t\", 'images': [], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://gaadiwaadi.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo-posted-82-growth-in-fy25-highest-among-suvs/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://taazanewsfactory.com/en/mahindra-xuv-3xo-sales-growth-82-percent/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.rushlane.com/mahindra-sales-breakup-june-2025-scorpio-thar-bolero-12525839.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry.

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,095 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://autotorque.in/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-features-and-performance/', 'content': \"Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: A Comprehensive Analysis of Features and Performance - Auto Torque Skip to content Auto Torque New Car and Bike's News Home Latest News Latest Cars Latest Bikes Electric Vehicles (EVs) Hybrid Cars Auto Torque New Car and Bike's News || Latest News || Latest Cars || Latest Bikes || Electric Vehicles (EVs) || Hybrid Cars || Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: A Comprehensive Analysis of Features and Performance Leave a Comment / By Auto Torque / 9 August 2024 Mahindra has unleashed the XUV 3XO, a revamped version of the XUV300, aimed at dominating the compact SUV segment.

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price?

The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness.

In an era where road safety is a growing concern, informed consumers depend on these ratings to ensure that their chosen vehicle offers the highest level of protection. The Mahindra XUV 3XO exemplifies this commitment to safety and performance, showcasing Mahindra's dedication to quality, durability, and innovation. Beyond evaluating safety features, making sound financial decisions is crucial when purchasing a vehicle. This is where car loans become invaluable tools. Financing options, such as the new car loan from Bajaj Finance, provide the flexibility needed to make car ownership more manageable.

This article will explore the safety ratings of the Mahindra XUV 3XO and its impressive safety features. We will also examine how a Bajaj Finserv New Car Loan can assist you in funding your vehicle purchase. What are safety ratings and who provides them? Safety ratings are critical indicators of how well a vehicle can protect its occupants during a crash. These ratings are given after comprehensive testing by independent organisations that assess various aspects of vehicle safety. These include structural integrity, airbag effectiveness, and safety assist technologies. The aim is to help potential buyers make an informed decision about a cars ability to safeguard its passengers. Here are the main organisations that provide safety ratings: Global NCAP : This globally respected body conducts crash tests and rates vehicles on a scale from one to five stars based on their performance in various crash scenarios. Euro NCAP : Known for its detailed evaluations, this organisation focuses on adult and child protection, pedestrian safety, and safety assist technologies. Bharat NCAP : Indias official safety programme , which ensures that vehicles sold in the country meet national safety standards. These organisations help car buyers by providing objective safety information that can guide their decision-making process. When it comes to the Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating, it has received excellent scores from these testing bodies, making it one of the top contenders for buyers who prioritise safety. All about Mahindra XUV 3XO safety ratings The Mahindra XUV 3XO has made a significant impact in the market, particularly for its safety credentials. The vehicle received a five-star safety rating in the Bharat NCAP crash tests, making it one of the safest options in its category. This rating means that the XUV 3XO excels in both adult occupant protection and child occupant protection, with the latest updates improving its safety features. The XUV 3XO inherits the solid safety foundation of its predecessor, the XUV300, which also received a five-star rating in the Global NCAP tests. This makes the XUV 3XO an attractive choice for those who value safety as much as performance. The Mahindra XUV 3XO also boasts a level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), which includes features like adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, auto emergency braking (AEB), traffic sign recognition, high beam assist, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, smart pilot assist.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well.

In the process, this models sales since launch on February 14, 2019, will also surpass 350,000 units. By Ajit Dalvi 14 Feb 2025 12985 Views Share - The Mahindra XUV300, reborn in a new avatar in April 2024 as the XUV 3XO , turns six years old today. Launched on February 14 and Valentines Day in 2019, the popular compact SUV has, till end-January 2025, has sold a total of 335,017 units. Thanks to the XUV 3XO, this compact Mahindra SUVs growth trajectory is currently at its best yet since launch, having sold 85,990 units, up 80% YoY (April 2023-January 2024: 47,672 units). The launch of the XUV 3XO (above right) in April 2024 has accelerated sales. The 85,990 units sold in the first 10 months of FY2025 are up 80% YoY. At this pace, the 3XO will go on to hit the 100,000-units sales mark in FY2025. Not only are the XUV 3XOs sales in the first 10 months of FY2025 already the highest in a fiscal, having beaten the previous best of 60,968 units of FY2023, but with February-March 2025 sales yet to be pencilled in, they are set to hit the 100,000 sales mark in FY2025. In the process, this models cumulative sales since launch will also surpass 350,000 units. Whats amply clear is that the rollout of the XUV 3XO in end-April 2024 has accelerated sales. Year-on-year, M&M has sold an additional 38,318 units. This compact SUV is currently the second best-selling Mahindra SUV after the Scorpio twins (137,311 units). That the XUV300 would become another Mahindra high-selling SUV was seen soon after launch seven years ago the company received 13,000 bookings in the first 28 days . The Mahindra compact SUV went on to hit 200,000 sales in May 2023 , 47 months after launch. The 300,000 milestone came up 16 months later in early October 2024. Given the current rapid pace of sales, the 400,000 sales milestone should be achieved in even fewer months. At present, the 3XO is 65,747 units away from that big number and should hit it around August-September 2025. What is helping accelerate sales for this SUV is the gains coming from M&Ms heightened focus on safety. In mid-November 2024, the XUV 3XO, along with the Thar Roxx and XUV400, aced the Bharat NCAP crash test . These models have now joined Mahindras growing portfolio of five-star-rated vehicles, which includes the XUV700 and Scorpio-N. 3X0 AS A SALES ACCELERATOR TO MAHINDRAS STELLAR GROWTH In FY2024, with 54,726 units, the XUV300 contributed 12% to the companys dealer dispatches and was among the prime movers that powered M&M to its best-ever fiscal year sales of 459,877 units and also among Indias Top 20 best-selling utility vehicles in FY2024 .

AUTO PUNDITZ January 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Feb 20 5 min read In this January 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Gunning For The 2nd Spot While their usual sales heroes like the Scorpio and XUV700 have been performing well for several years now, the 3XO along with some help from Thar Roxx, Mahindra are shaking up the auto industry. And this behaviour isnt going to change. With the BE6 and XEV 9e, they have conveyed that theyre not just here to sell electric cars. Theyre here to set new benchmarks in terms of value and features. The pricing of these 2 EVs has shaken up not just carmakers like Hyundai, Tata and Maruti but also the Chinese/Chinese-owned carmakers like MG and BYD are feeling the sting. So much so that MG jacked up the prices of the ZS while leaving the base price unchanged. On top of that, they are willing to give away discounts of up to ~Rs. 2.50 lakh on the base trim, which is the highest we have ever seen. So, the price hike was just a smoke screen when in reality, they are feeling the pinch from Mahindras BE6 and the Tata Curvv EV. We were counting on having a price war in the EV space in the 2025 - 28 period but a non-Chinese carmaker would take the first swing that, we didnt expect. The first swing will come from an Indian carmaker, that didnt just come as a surprise, it came as a shock. Its not this move that should scare the Chinese and even other carmakers. Its their attitude and hunger for greater market share, which should scare their rivals. The EV strategy suggests that this time around, they arent just going for one more bite out of the pie. They want the whole pie to themselves. Of course, it's not going to be easy but it looks like they are gunning for it anyway. That should make Hyundai very worried as they have maintained their hold on the 2nd spot in the Indian car market for God knows how long. Carmaker Jan 2025 Jan 2024 YoY% 12M Avg Maruti 1,73,599 1,66,802 +4.07% 1,46,850 Hyundai 54,003 57,013 -5.28% 50,193 Mahindra 50,659 43,068 +17.63% 44,950 Tata 48,075 53,635 -10.37% 46,409 Compared to Jan 2024, Mahindra and Maruti have gained market share while Hyundai and Tata have lost. Mahindra's YoY gains of 17.63% come across as enormous compared to Marutis. However, the YoY decline of 10.37% in Tatas sales suggests that they have graduated from 4th spot to 3rd. Since Hyundai also appear to have suffered some YoY decline in Jan 2025, its not too far-fetched to imagine that once Mahindra are feeling secure in the 3rd spot, they will be preparing to displace Hyundai from the 2nd spot. In average sales, though, Hyundai remain firmly in the 2nd spot while Tata in 3rd spot. Mahindra are in the 4th spot with an average shortage of 1459 every month. We expect them to easily make up this gap and create a larger gap for Tata to crawl in this calendar year. For 2025, Tata are also lining up the Sierra petrol/diesel and Sierra EV along with the Harrier EV. Mahindra are likely to bring a 3-row electric car (similar t\", 'images': [], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://gaadiwaadi.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo-posted-82-growth-in-fy25-highest-among-suvs/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://taazanewsfactory.com/en/mahindra-xuv-3xo-sales-growth-82-percent/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.rushlane.com/mahindra-sales-breakup-june-2025-scorpio-thar-bolero-12525839.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

By Ajit Dalvi 14 Feb 2025 12985 Views Share - The Mahindra XUV300, reborn in a new avatar in April 2024 as the XUV 3XO , turns six years old today. Launched on February 14 and Valentines Day in 2019, the popular compact SUV has, till end-January 2025, has sold a total of 335,017 units. Thanks to the XUV 3XO, this compact Mahindra SUVs growth trajectory is currently at its best yet since launch, having sold 85,990 units, up 80% YoY (April 2023-January 2024: 47,672 units). The launch of the XUV 3XO (above right) in April 2024 has accelerated sales. The 85,990 units sold in the first 10 months of FY2025 are up 80% YoY. At this pace, the 3XO will go on to hit the 100,000-units sales mark in FY2025. Not only are the XUV 3XOs sales in the first 10 months of FY2025 already the highest in a fiscal, having beaten the previous best of 60,968 units of FY2023, but with February-March 2025 sales yet to be pencilled in, they are set to hit the 100,000 sales mark in FY2025. In the process, this models cumulative sales since launch will also surpass 350,000 units. Whats amply clear is that the rollout of the XUV 3XO in end-April 2024 has accelerated sales. Year-on-year, M&M has sold an additional 38,318 units. This compact SUV is currently the second best-selling Mahindra SUV after the Scorpio twins (137,311 units). That the XUV300 would become another Mahindra high-selling SUV was seen soon after launch seven years ago the company received 13,000 bookings in the first 28 days . The Mahindra compact SUV went on to hit 200,000 sales in May 2023 , 47 months after launch. The 300,000 milestone came up 16 months later in early October 2024. Given the current rapid pace of sales, the 400,000 sales milestone should be achieved in even fewer months. At present, the 3XO is 65,747 units away from that big number and should hit it around August-September 2025. What is helping accelerate sales for this SUV is the gains coming from M&Ms heightened focus on safety. In mid-November 2024, the XUV 3XO, along with the Thar Roxx and XUV400, aced the Bharat NCAP crash test . These models have now joined Mahindras growing portfolio of five-star-rated vehicles, which includes the XUV700 and Scorpio-N. 3X0 AS A SALES ACCELERATOR TO MAHINDRAS STELLAR GROWTH In FY2024, with 54,726 units, the XUV300 contributed 12% to the companys dealer dispatches and was among the prime movers that powered M&M to its best-ever fiscal year sales of 459,877 units and also among Indias Top 20 best-selling utility vehicles in FY2024 .

AUTO PUNDITZ January 2025 Mahindra Sales Analysis YoY, MoM Change, 6-Month Trend V3Cars Feb 20 5 min read In this January 2025 Mahindra car sales analysis, well look at the car sales of Mahindra for the previous month. Well also compare the YoY and MoM change to find out which Mahindra cars sales improved and which ones declined. To support the trends, well also provide our opinions where applicable. Lastly, the table with monthly sales for the last 6 months will give you an idea about the 6-month sales trend of all Mahindra cars. Gunning For The 2nd Spot While their usual sales heroes like the Scorpio and XUV700 have been performing well for several years now, the 3XO along with some help from Thar Roxx, Mahindra are shaking up the auto industry. And this behaviour isnt going to change. With the BE6 and XEV 9e, they have conveyed that theyre not just here to sell electric cars. Theyre here to set new benchmarks in terms of value and features. The pricing of these 2 EVs has shaken up not just carmakers like Hyundai, Tata and Maruti but also the Chinese/Chinese-owned carmakers like MG and BYD are feeling the sting. So much so that MG jacked up the prices of the ZS while leaving the base price unchanged. On top of that, they are willing to give away discounts of up to ~Rs. 2.50 lakh on the base trim, which is the highest we have ever seen. So, the price hike was just a smoke screen when in reality, they are feeling the pinch from Mahindras BE6 and the Tata Curvv EV. We were counting on having a price war in the EV space in the 2025 - 28 period but a non-Chinese carmaker would take the first swing that, we didnt expect. The first swing will come from an Indian carmaker, that didnt just come as a surprise, it came as a shock. Its not this move that should scare the Chinese and even other carmakers. Its their attitude and hunger for greater market share, which should scare their rivals. The EV strategy suggests that this time around, they arent just going for one more bite out of the pie. They want the whole pie to themselves. Of course, it's not going to be easy but it looks like they are gunning for it anyway. That should make Hyundai very worried as they have maintained their hold on the 2nd spot in the Indian car market for God knows how long. Carmaker Jan 2025 Jan 2024 YoY% 12M Avg Maruti 1,73,599 1,66,802 +4.07% 1,46,850 Hyundai 54,003 57,013 -5.28% 50,193 Mahindra 50,659 43,068 +17.63% 44,950 Tata 48,075 53,635 -10.37% 46,409 Compared to Jan 2024, Mahindra and Maruti have gained market share while Hyundai and Tata have lost. Mahindra's YoY gains of 17.63% come across as enormous compared to Marutis. However, the YoY decline of 10.37% in Tatas sales suggests that they have graduated from 4th spot to 3rd. Since Hyundai also appear to have suffered some YoY decline in Jan 2025, its not too far-fetched to imagine that once Mahindra are feeling secure in the 3rd spot, they will be preparing to displace Hyundai from the 2nd spot. In average sales, though, Hyundai remain firmly in the 2nd spot while Tata in 3rd spot. Mahindra are in the 4th spot with an average shortage of 1459 every month. We expect them to easily make up this gap and create a larger gap for Tata to crawl in this calendar year. For 2025, Tata are also lining up the Sierra petrol/diesel and Sierra EV along with the Harrier EV. Mahindra are likely to bring a 3-row electric car (similar t\", 'images': [], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://gaadiwaadi.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo-posted-82-growth-in-fy25-highest-among-suvs/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://taazanewsfactory.com/en/mahindra-xuv-3xo-sales-growth-82-percent/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.rushlane.com/mahindra-sales-breakup-june-2025-scorpio-thar-bolero-12525839.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",
