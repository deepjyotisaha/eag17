Use ONLY ONE step of CoderAgent but use MULTIPLE ITERATIONS (call_self=True) of the same step to enrich the game logic, visual or layout! You dont need any clarifications. You dont need to build reports. Use beautiful theme and colour schemes, layout etc. You get extra money for making this visually appealing!",
