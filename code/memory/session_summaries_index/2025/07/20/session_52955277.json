SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage. SUV Market Trends Expansion of hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV offerings could emerge as a key factor strengthening the SUV industry. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs are gaining popularity as a transitional solution for consumers who want improved fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric vehicles. Automakers are expanding their hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUV lineups, offering models with incre\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-size-by-suv-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'SUV Market Size, By SUV, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/suv-market-revenue-share-by-propulsion-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'title': 'SUV Market Revenue Share, By Propulsion, 2023', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://cdn.gminsights.com/image/rd/automotive-and-transportation/asia-pacific-suv-market-size-2024-2032.webp', 'alt_text': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'title': 'Asia Pacific SUV Market Size, 2022-2032 (USD Billion)', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/suv-market-108263', 'content': 'SUV Market Size, Trends | Growth [2033] SUV Market Industries Information & Technology Healthcare Machinery & Equipment Automotive & Transportation Food & Beverages Energy & Power Aerospace & Defense Agriculture Chemicals & Materials Architecture Consumer Goods Blogs About Contact Home Automotive & Transportation SUV Market SUV Market Size, Share, Growth, and Industry Analysis, By Types (Diesel, Petrol, Others) , Applications (Remote areas, Recreation, Motorsport) and Regional Insights and Forecast to 2033 Request a FREE Sample PDF Buy Now Last Updated: June 30 , 2025 Base Year: 2024 Historical Data: 2020-2023 No of Pages: 109 SKU ID: 25204558 Request a FREE Sample PDF Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Summary TOC Drivers & Opportunity Segmentation Regional Outlook Key Players Methodology FAQ Request a FREE Sample PDF SUV Market Size The global SUV market size was valued at USD 2.97 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 3.04 billion in 2025, eventually expanding to USD 3.71 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 2.5% from 2025 to 2033.

by Type (Sub-Compact, Compact, Mid-size, Full-size and MPV), Propulsion (Internal Combustion Engine, Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) and Region (North America,Europe and Asia-Pacific) - Forecast 2030\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering. The SUV market is projected to reach 53 million units by 2030 from 41 million units in 2024, at a CAGR of 4.4%. The report will help the market leaders/new entrants in this market with information on the closest approximations of the sales numbers for the SUVs and their subsegments. This report will help stakeholders understand the competitive landscape and gain more insights to position their businesses better and to plan suitable go-to-market strategies. The report also helps stakeholders understand the pulse of the market and provides them with information on key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities. The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies. Further, the introduction of autonomous SUVs with enhanced safety features and higher level of automation is shifting the trends in the SUV market. Moreover, OEMs are focused on reducing the production cost of the vehicle by standadizing the platform technology and planning & developing unique platforms for all the SUVs under their brand. Furthermore, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) SUVs can be a major break-through in the SUVs market. Although the FCEV technology is still in the initial stages, planned research & development is carried out and can become a next major factor in the overall automotive industry, SUVs included. In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s. Autonomous SUVs are anticipated to witness growth Autonomous SUVs are projected to grow significantly during the forecast due to the rising demand for safety, comfort, and driving convenience features.

The India SUV market is witnessing remarkable growth, driven by changing consumer preferences and a rising middle class.

Market Overview Forecast Period 2026-2030 Market Size 2024 USD 18.13 Billion Market Size 2030 USD 33.85 Billion CAGR 2025-2030 10.97% Fastest Growing Segment Compact Largest Market North India Market Drivers: Rising Disposable Incomes and Lifestyle Aspirations India's growing middle-class population and increasing disposable incomes have played a pivotal role in driving the demand for SUVs. As economic stability rises, consumers are shifting their preferences toward vehicles that offer superior comfort, spacious interiors, and advanced features. SUVs are seen as a status symbol, blending practicality with style, making them a popular choice among urban and semi-urban buyers.

Expanding Road Infrastructure and Urbanization The rapid expansion of road networks, highways, and expressways in India has made SUVs a practical choice for consumers. Improved infrastructure allows SUVs to showcase their versatility, catering to both city commuting and off-road adventures. Additionally, the rise in urbanization has contributed to the popularity of compact and mid-sized SUVs, which offer the commanding driving position and road presence that urban dwellers seek, while remaining maneuverable in congested traffic. Rural markets are also contributing to SUV sales as improved connectivity to urban centers increases the demand for vehicles capable of handling varied terrains.

By Shruti Shiraguppi 20 May 2025 3837 Views Share - In India's automotive discourse, a common lament echoes through industry analysis: SUVs have killed the beloved small car. While this narrative captures part of the truthhatchback segment share has indeed plummeted from 34.0% in Q4FY2023 to just 24.0% in Q4FY2025it misses a more nuanced reality emerging in the market. Within the SUV segment itself, a fascinating inverse relationship between vehicle size and growth rate has emerged, with smaller SUVs dramatically outperforming their larger counterparts. Shipment data reveals a striking pattern: in FY2025, growth rates across SUV categories almost perfectly correlate inversely with vehicle size. As SUVs get smaller, their market performance gets strongerchallenging conventional wisdom about India's automotive future. The Inverse Correlation: Size vs. Growth in India's SUV Market The data tells a compelling story of how SUV growth rates in FY2025 demonstrate an almost perfect inverse relationship with vehicle size: Micro SUVs (< 4m) : 20.4% year-over-year growth Compact SUVs (< 4m) : 13.5% year-over-year growth Mid SUVs (> 4m) : 9.8% year-over-year growth Large SUVs (> 4m) : 6.1% year-over-year growth Premium SUVs : 10.0% year-over-year decline This pattern suggests that while SUVs as a category are flourishing, consumer preferences are skewing decisively toward more accessible, compact offeringsa trend that runs counter to the perception of relentless upsizing in the Indian market. Micro SUVs (< 4m): The Explosive Growth Segment Market Performance The Micro SUV segment registered the highest growth in FY2025 at a remarkable 20.4% year-over-year, with sales surging from 424,197 units in FY2024 to 510,793 units in FY2025. This segment now commands 11.8% of the total passenger vehicle market, up from 10.1% in the previous fiscal year. Popular Models Key models driving this growth include the Tata Punch, Maruti Suzuki Fronx, Hyundai Exter, Nissan Magnite, and Renault Kiger. These vehicles typically offer SUV styling, higher ground clearance, and feature-rich cabins in a sub-4 meter footprint. Vendor Performance Tata Motors : Maintains segment leadership with the Punch, commanding 38.5% market share in FY2025, though slightly down from 39.8% in FY2024. Maruti Suzuki : Strengthened its position with the Fronx, increasing market share to 32.5% in FY2025 from 31.8% in FY2024. Hyundai : Captured 15.2% market share with the Exter, though down from 16.8% in FY2024. Toyota : New entrant to the segment in FY2025, quickly securing 5.8% market share. Nissan-Renault : Combined share declined from 10.2% to 7.5%, suggesting challenges in maintaining momentum against newer competitors. Compact SUVs (< 4m): Solid Growth Continues Market Performance Compact SUVs posted strong 13.5% year-over-year growth in FY2025, with volumes increasing from 614,009 units to 697,013 units. This segment represents 16.1% of the total passenger vehicle market, up from 14.6% in FY2024.

SUVs have gained popularity due to shifting consumer preferences towards vehicles that offer versatility, space, and a higher driving position. Many consumers perceive SUVs as more practical for various lifestyles, including families, outdoor enthusiasts, and urban commuters. The desire for vehicles capable of accommodating passengers, cargo, and diverse road conditions has driven the demand for SUVs. For Instance, in March 2024, the Peugeot E-5008 made headlines by setting a new standard as the sole all-electric SUV boasting spacious accommodation for up to 7 passengers and an impressive electric range of up to 660 km. Built upon the STLA Medium platform and equipped with a domestically manufactured battery, the E-5008 caters perfectly to the demands of customers seeking a sizable SUV with a bold design, inviting interior, and efficient electric performance. Peugeot ensures complete peace of mind for its clientele by offering the E-5008 with 8 years or 160,000 km coverage through its ALLURE CARE program. Crafted as an electric model from inception, the new E-5008 features a selection of zero-emission motors (WLTP cycles pending approval), ranging from 500 to 660 km in electric range, including an AWD Dual Motor and a Long-Range variant. With advancements in technology, SUVs have become more fuel-efficient compared to their predecessors. Automakers have introduced hybrid and electric SUV models to address environmental concerns and comply with stricter emissions regulations. For instance, in March 2024, BMW unveiled its plan to reveal the Vision Neue Klasse X SUV on March 21st, 2024. This model marks the latest addition to the company's electric SUV lineup, evident from the inclusion of the 'X' designation in its name, signifying its connection to BMW's existing X range of SUVs. The upcoming electric SUV not only represents a glimpse into BMW's forthcoming SUV offerings but also serves as a precursor to its future SUV lineup. Forming a part of BMW's Neue Klasse EV platform , this concept SUV will serve as the foundation for six new vehicles set to debut by 2025. Among these releases is a robust five-seater SUV set to follow in the footsteps of the iX3. Additionally, the perception of SUVs as safer vehicles due to their size and robust construction has contributed to their sustained popularity despite concerns about fuel consumption and emissions. However, despite advancements in fuel efficiency and the emergence of electric SUVs, environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption remain significant. Stricter emissions regulations imposed by governments worldwide may limit the appeal of traditional gas-powered SUVs, leading to increased scrutiny and potential restrictions on their sales and usage.

This report will help stakeholders understand the competitive landscape and gain more insights to position their businesses better and to plan suitable go-to-market strategies. The report also helps stakeholders understand the pulse of the market and provides them with information on key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities. The SUV market is expected to experience growth driven by various factors. The automotive industry is currently under constant pressure to adapt to new changes due to technological advancements and end-user preferences. Adoption of electric SUVs is the key factor that has witnessed a rapid change in the SUVs market. In line with the EV sector, development and manufacturing of long-range batteries along with installation of fast and ultra-fast charging points for customers is the foremost agenda of the OEMs and EV solution providing companies. Further, the introduction of autonomous SUVs with enhanced safety features and higher level of automation is shifting the trends in the SUV market. Moreover, OEMs are focused on reducing the production cost of the vehicle by standadizing the platform technology and planning & developing unique platforms for all the SUVs under their brand. Furthermore, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) SUVs can be a major break-through in the SUVs market. Although the FCEV technology is still in the initial stages, planned research & development is carried out and can become a next major factor in the overall automotive industry, SUVs included. In addition, the current HEVs and BEVs are rapidly growing as several countries in Europe have put forth a strict plan for achieving ZEV targets. EV segment growth to 2030 The BEV, HEV and PHEV segments are expected to lead the SUV market during the forecast period. The growth of EVs is due to the Euro-7 implementation and ICE ban timelines. This has led to new EV SUV launches in 2022 and 2023. Similarly, over 20 new models of electric vehicles are set to launch in 2024 & 2025. This will lead to rapid adoption of EVs SUVs over ICE SUVs. Moreover, long range powered batteries and fast charging public points will lead to overcoming the major restraining factors of the EV market growth. For instance, in December 2023, Toyota launched a new long range Crown Sport PHEV model to cater the Japanese market. Similarly, market leaders such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Telsa amongst others have launched long range BEV models in different regional markets in the past two years. Having said that the volume of HEV will rise but till 2030 and will be stagnant for some years and then decline gradually to be replaced by BEVs. This will majorly happen due to the current limited range of the batteries and need to frequently charge the batteries during long distance travel, which will not be an restraint during 2030s. Autonomous SUVs are anticipated to witness growth Autonomous SUVs are projected to grow significantly during the forecast due to the rising demand for safety, comfort, and driving convenience features.

Expanding Road Infrastructure and Urbanization The rapid expansion of road networks, highways, and expressways in India has made SUVs a practical choice for consumers.

By Shruti Shiraguppi 20 May 2025 3837 Views Share - In India's automotive discourse, a common lament echoes through industry analysis: SUVs have killed the beloved small car. While this narrative captures part of the truthhatchback segment share has indeed plummeted from 34.0% in Q4FY2023 to just 24.0% in Q4FY2025it misses a more nuanced reality emerging in the market. Within the SUV segment itself, a fascinating inverse relationship between vehicle size and growth rate has emerged, with smaller SUVs dramatically outperforming their larger counterparts. Shipment data reveals a striking pattern: in FY2025, growth rates across SUV categories almost perfectly correlate inversely with vehicle size. As SUVs get smaller, their market performance gets strongerchallenging conventional wisdom about India's automotive future. The Inverse Correlation: Size vs. Growth in India's SUV Market The data tells a compelling story of how SUV growth rates in FY2025 demonstrate an almost perfect inverse relationship with vehicle size: Micro SUVs (< 4m) : 20.4% year-over-year growth Compact SUVs (< 4m) : 13.5% year-over-year growth Mid SUVs (> 4m) : 9.8% year-over-year growth Large SUVs (> 4m) : 6.1% year-over-year growth Premium SUVs : 10.0% year-over-year decline This pattern suggests that while SUVs as a category are flourishing, consumer preferences are skewing decisively toward more accessible, compact offeringsa trend that runs counter to the perception of relentless upsizing in the Indian market. Micro SUVs (< 4m): The Explosive Growth Segment Market Performance The Micro SUV segment registered the highest growth in FY2025 at a remarkable 20.4% year-over-year, with sales surging from 424,197 units in FY2024 to 510,793 units in FY2025. This segment now commands 11.8% of the total passenger vehicle market, up from 10.1% in the previous fiscal year. Popular Models Key models driving this growth include the Tata Punch, Maruti Suzuki Fronx, Hyundai Exter, Nissan Magnite, and Renault Kiger. These vehicles typically offer SUV styling, higher ground clearance, and feature-rich cabins in a sub-4 meter footprint. Vendor Performance Tata Motors : Maintains segment leadership with the Punch, commanding 38.5% market share in FY2025, though slightly down from 39.8% in FY2024. Maruti Suzuki : Strengthened its position with the Fronx, increasing market share to 32.5% in FY2025 from 31.8% in FY2024. Hyundai : Captured 15.2% market share with the Exter, though down from 16.8% in FY2024. Toyota : New entrant to the segment in FY2025, quickly securing 5.8% market share. Nissan-Renault : Combined share declined from 10.2% to 7.5%, suggesting challenges in maintaining momentum against newer competitors. Compact SUVs (< 4m): Solid Growth Continues Market Performance Compact SUVs posted strong 13.5% year-over-year growth in FY2025, with volumes increasing from 614,009 units to 697,013 units. This segment represents 16.1% of the total passenger vehicle market, up from 14.6% in FY2024.

According to MarketsandMarkets Analysis, of total premium cars produced globally, the share of premium SUVs stood at ~53% in 2016, which grew to ~62% in 2021.

For instance, in 2021, the production of luxury SUVs in the US out of total luxury cars was around 75%. On the other hand, developing countries such as China, Brazil, and India have shown tremendous growth in SUVs demand during previous years.

This robust expansion is driven by a confluence of factors including shifting consumer preferences towards spacious and versatile vehicles, increasing urbanization, and technological advancements in vehicle design and fuel efficiency. The versatility and enhanced safety features offered by SUVs make them particularly appealing to a broad range of consumers, further fueling market growth. Moreover, the rising popularity of electric and hybrid SUVs as environmentally-friendly alternatives contributes significantly to the expanding market landscape. One of the primary growth factors for the SUV market is the rising consumer inclination towards vehicles that offer greater flexibility, comfort, and utility. The SUV's design, which typically includes more passenger and cargo space compared to traditional cars, attracts a diverse consumer base, from families seeking practicality to individuals desiring a sense of adventure and off-road capability.
