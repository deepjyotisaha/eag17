If you are blessed with a long holiday and want to experience a variety of rural ryokan (traditional Japanese-style inn) stays, youll find plenty of inspiration in our Luxury Ryokans & the Japanese Countryside itinerary. But what if youre a bit shorter on time, and only have 1 or 2 nights to spare in between visits to Tokyo and Kyoto? To complement days of exploring Tokyo and strolling the backstreets of Kyoto , there is nothing more relaxing than a short escape into the Japanese countryside. Gora Kadan Luxury Ryokans Near Tokyo and Kyoto Heres the thing: Japan has countless beautiful and authentic ryokans, but not all are convenient for travelers en route from Tokyo to Kyoto (or Osaka ) or vice versa. So we curated this short list of our favorite luxury ryokans, especially for travelers with discerning taste but a limited amount of time. After all, if youre strapped for time, traveling to a remote corner of Japan may not be the best use of your efforts and may leave you with little time or energy to enjoy the destination or the journey! The carefully selected properties below are perfect if you want to stay in one of Japans best ryokans, without too much of a detour from the Tokyo-Kyoto path. Theyre located in a small handful of picturesque areas of Japan including the Izu Peninsula, Hakone National Park, and the lovely Hokuriku region (home to Kanazawa) that are relatively easy to reach and combine well with the Kanto and Kansai regions (where Tokyo and Kyoto are located, respectively). Some are slightly more remote than others, but all are well suited to short stays. Youll have time to kick off your shoes, settle into the gentle pace of the countryside, and spend a peaceful day or two in bliss as you soak it all in. Most importantly, each of these luxurious ryokans offers wonderful Japanese hospitality, soothing onsen (hot springs), and impeccable kaiseki cuisine featuring seasonal and local specialties. So relax, kick back, and enjoy this list of rejuvenating ryokans for your next Japan trip! Yagyu no Sho Luxury Ryokans in the Izu Peninsula The Izu Peninsula (Izu Hanto in Japanese) is a rugged and beautiful area located just a couple of hours southwest of Tokyo, a very easy journey via Japans wonderful rail system . The whole of Izu is blessed with pristine forests, stunning coastlines, and more than its fair share of gorgeous ryokans and onsen. Izu is just slightly more of a detour than Hakone (more on Hakone below), and makes for a perfect rural retreat en route between Tokyo and Kyoto. If you can afford to spend two nights here it is worthwhile, but even with one night you can have a wonderful experience. Plan on about 2 hours from Tokyo by train, and about 3 hours 30 minutes from Kyoto by train and shinkansen (bullet train). Its worth highlighting that, since Izu is less known than Hakone, you can expect a slightly more off-the-beaten-path feel than you would likely find in Hakone. Some of our favorite luxury ryokans in the Izu Peninsula include: Asaba : A historic and luxurious ryokan renowned for its beautiful rooms, soothing onsen, and warm service, located in the hot springs village of Shuzenji Onsen. Yagyu no Sho: Another wonderful luxury ryokan in Shuzenji, boasting wonderful onsen and fantastic kaiseki cuisine. Hanafubuki : While not quite as luxurious as Asaba and Yagyu no Sho above, this is an excellent high-end ryokan with great service and an unparalleled variety of private onsen options. Gora Kadan Luxury Ryokans in Hakone The Hakone region is a well-known national park area full of ryokans and onsen, and on clear days offers stunning views of Mount Fuji. Because of its convenient location and its relative proximity to Fujisan Hakone is almost always the first place travelers ask us about when considering a ryokan stay. (Its also featured in our 8-day Japan Essentials sample trip .) As with the Izu Peninsula above, Hakone is a perfect stopover for one or two nights if youre traveling between Tokyo and Kyoto or Osaka. Plan on about 90 minutes by rail from Tokyo, and about 2 hours 30 minutes by bullet train to Kyoto. If there is a drawback to Hakone, its that its fame and convenience make it a very popular (and often crowded) destination for travelers from around the world, as well as from within Japan. Befitting an iconic onsen destination, Hakone has too many excellent ryokans to name. Some of our favorite luxury ryokans in Hakone include: Gora Kadan : Gora Kadan is one of Japans best-known luxury ryokans, and offers several stunning Japanese-style suites featuring private open-air baths. Gora Hanaougi : Another luxury ryokan located in Hakones Gora area, Gora Hanaougi is a small ryokan where each room boasts its very own private open-air bath. Yamanochaya : Also written Yama no Chaya, this high-end ryokan is conveniently located in the Tonosawa area, near Hakone-Yumoto. Beniya Mukayu Luxury Ryokans in Hokuriku Maybe youve never heard of Hokuriku, but if youve been doing research for your Japan trip you may have heard of the historic city of Kanazawa . Located in central Japans Hokuriku region, Kanazawa is one of Japans most worthwhile destinations . Hokuriku is blessed with scenic coastal and mountain landscapes, a rich traditional culture, and some of the best food youll find anywhere in Japan (including several of Japans best sushi restaurants). Hokuriku is a bit further geographically than Izu or Hakone (see above), so we typically recommend visiting for 2 nights or more (while not impossible, 1 night would inevitably feel rushed). Kanazawa, and Hokuriku in general, forms an elegant triangle with Tokyo and Kyoto, and the three make for an ideal itinerary. To reach Kanazawa, plan on a bit over 3 hours from Tokyo on the magnificent Hokuriku Shinkansen . If possible, we recommend splurging on Gran Class, a particularly luxurious class of service only available on very few trains in Japan. Kanazawa is just over 2 hours by express train from Kyoto. Some of our favorite luxury ryokans in the Hokuriku region include: Beniya Mukayu : Located in the Kaga Onsen area outside of Kanazawa proper, this is a boutique ryokan with excellent food, where each guest room has its own private open-air bath. Kayotei : Also located in the Kaga Onsen area, Kayotei is a wonderful traditional ryokan with warm service and fantastic food, not to mention soothing onsen. Asadaya : A small and intimate luxury ryokan in the heart of Kanazawa, with impeccable service and cuisine.

If youre staying there, you can easily visit the beautiful Sensoji temple and the Thunder Gate, the famous Kaminarimon. Its quite a sight, especially by night. The Kamagowa ryokan has a less modern style. Its a bit more traditional than the Takemine; there are tatami mats all over the bedrooms and baths are made of wood.

Book It Now : Onsen Ryokan Yuen Bettei Tokyo Daita 5. Ryokan Fuji The Ryokan Fuji is in not on Mount Fuji but definitely in Tokyo, near the Koiwa station, in the north-east of Tokyo. It is located a little bit further from the city center than the three previous hotels, which could end up being an advantage because the surrounding area is much quieter. Although the hotels beautiful and quiet garden has probably a lot to do with this. Book It Here : Ryokan Fuji Lets end this list with the Homeikan, the ryokan where I stayed and which will be our focus for the upcoming part of this blog post. 6. cyashitsu ryokan asakusa Smack bang in the middle of Asakusa is cyashitsu ryokan asakusa, a stunning traditional inn that will transport you right back into the Edo period even though youre in the middle of the busiest city in the world! Featuring traditional Japanese low-rise furniture, aesthetic Japanese wallpaper, ambient lighting, and plenty of privacy, itd be hard to imagine that only a few steps away are hundreds of thousands of people milling the streets of Tokyo. Upon arrival, you will be greeted with sweets and tea, and there is also a foot bath for you to relax to. There is an amazing private rooftop onsen which you can book, but there are rooms that also come with their onsen bath. The location is sublime, being located close to Asakusa center and all its attractions, so you really wont need to worry about transport at all! Guests Tips : Book the private onsen when you check in, as its an experience not to be missed! The rooms are smaller than what you may be used to, so if youre larger than the average person, be warned! However, many have described it as cozy. Book It Now : cyashitsu ryokan asakusa 7.Homeikan The Homeikan is one of the most traditional ryokan in Tokyo. It is located in the Hongo district which is known to be the center of knowledge and Japanese culture. As a matter of fact, many Japanese scholars and researchers used to stay there. Its also in that district that you find the prestigious Tokyo University, more commonly known as Todai (an abbreviation of Tokyo daikagu ). Once you get to Homeikan, youll have to fill in a few forms and give your passport reference at the front desk where youll spot the representation of a bird with burning wings just above your head, if youre careful enough to see it! Its actually a phoenix and its not there by mere coincidence. The name Homeikan is not derived from the English word home but from the Japanese word ho-u which means phoenix. Me means shiny and kan refers to an inn. So Homeikan is the shiny phoenixs inn, so to speak. Smart name, right ? What I liked most about Homeikan is the fact that everything is made of wood which gives a very pleasant feel to the whole place. Youll also meet a nice Kappa at the entry hall; its a kind of frog thats present in a lot of Japanese myths. Ill tell you more about it in a blog post about Kappabashi street in Tokyo. Your stay at a ryokan always starts by taking off your shoes at the entry hall to put on a pair of slippers. Youll find many to choose from there. Dont forget to do that; its a mark of disrespect in Japan to step inside a house with your shoes on. Someone will then escort you to your room. This was mine, but of course rooms will vary in size according to the number of people staying there. Heres a bigger room thats more suitable for a family for example. Youll obviously sleep in futon beds which are very comfortable and could even be beneficial for your back. Youll also find Matcha and Japanese tea-making supplies: Yukata dresses will be at your disposal. They are traditional Japanese garment, something like dressing gowns worn after a bath or simply indoors. Speaking of baths, heres what Homeikan baths look like: Homeikan Japanese baths are in the bottom floor and of course, theres one for men and one for women. Youll come across a first room with a lot of baskets where you can put your clothes and your yukata . You can then access the bathroom, in your birthday suit, just to be clear.
