The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?
