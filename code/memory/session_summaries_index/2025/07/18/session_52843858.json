Published On May 08, 2024 07:30:00 AM 43,554 Views Follow us on By Autocar India News Desk Share - Mahindra recently announced prices for the heavily updated XUV300 , which is now christened the Mahindra XUV 3XO . While much is already known about the updated Tata Nexon rival, we take a closer look at the most significant changes in an interview with R Velusamy, president of automotive technology and product development at Mahindra. R Velusamy at the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Mahindra XUV 3XO: styling updates add practicality While the XUV 3XO got a major design overhaul, most of it has been cleverly confined to plastic bits and there arent many sheet metal changes. We have carried over the existing bonnet. Grille, bumper and headlamps are new, said Velusamy. At the back, the tailgate is the major sheet metal change. Boot space has increased by 40 litres. The previous tailgate was not looking attractive. The new-look tailgate has a flatter design with connected tail lamps, which look better. Also, the new tailgate is more vertically positioned; this along with a slightly deeper area in the boot and slight repositioning of the panels [means] there is 40 litres of more boot space. Mahindra has also reprofiled the XUV 3X0s rear bumper to give it a fresher look. Mahindra XUV 3XO now has a lot in common with XUV700 The XUV 3X0 has a lot more tech than the discontinued XUV300 and quite a bit has been carried over from the brands flagship, the XUV700. This not only creates greater economies of scale but also helps the brand avoid niggles later by choosing tried and tested components. The XUV 3X0 gets two infotainment head units; the one used in the AX line-up is from the XUV700 , explained Velusamy. The ADAS modules, the SVS setup with four cameras, and also the CDC (Cockpit domain control) system, except the display, are carried over. More than a few bits, like the infotainment unit, are shared with the XUV700. Additionally, the XUV 3XOs audio system components, including the amplifier, are actually the ones that will feature in the brands upcoming born-electric SUV line-up. Mahindra XUV 3XO powertrains get tweaks; new Aisin auto gearbox The XUV 3XO gets two 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine options, with the lower variants equipped with a non-direct injection motor that churns out 111hp and 200Nm. This engine is mated to a 6-speed manual as standard. The 1.2-litre TGDI petrol engine, which features direct injection, is good for 131hp and up to 250Nm of peak torque. While the 6-speed manual is also standard here, gearbox choices for both turbo-petrol engines include an Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic, which has been updated, too. This gearbox is the Gen 3 version from Aisin, which is more refined. It has better drivability thanthe Gen 2 variant and a higher oscillation, along', 'images': [{'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/20240507063144_First Drive 3XO Web.012.jpeg?w=700&c=1', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO: tech secrets decoded', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO: tech secrets decoded', 'class': 'img-fluid ne-lis-img', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/XUV 3XO x R Velusami.001.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO, R Velusamy', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO, R Velusamy', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/First Drive 3XO Web.015.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO boot', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO boot', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/First Drive 3XO Web.003.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/3XO Engine Collage.001.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO engine', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO engine', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/general-news/10-features-mahindra-xuv-3xo-gets-over-outgoing-xuv300/52944/', 'content': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets These 10 Features Over The XUV300 - ZigWheels 0 NEWS & REVIEWS NEW CARS NEW BIKES SCOOTERS MORE Used Cars Forum Home News 10 Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets Over Outgoing XUV300 Overview Price Variants Mileage Specs Offers Colours Images More 10 Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets Over Outgoing XUV300 Published May 6, 2024 Views : 1985 3 min read By Yashein Kewalramani Follow us The XUV 3XO, with the added features over the previous model, has become a more desirable and attractive SUV Mahindra has launched the XUV 3XO , which is basically a facelifted version of the XUV300. With this facelift, it gets an upgraded cabin with plenty of new features which make the SUV more premium, increasing its value proposition. In this report, we are going to take you through 10 features that the XUV 3XO packs over its predecessor. Panoramic Sunroof The XUV 3XO features a panoramic sunroof for its higher-end variants, a first for its segment. It is a feature which is usually offered on cars that are of a segment above. And fret not, lower-end variants also gets a sunroof, but a smaller single-pane unit. Level-2 ADAS The XUV 3XO comes equipped with Level-2 ADAS, making it the first in its segment to get this feature. Its rivals like the Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue get Level-1 ADAS with less features. The previous model did not get any driver aids. 10.25-inch Touchscreen Infotainment System The XUV 3XO gets a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which is borrowed from the XUV400 EV. This new infotainment system, which packs connected car tech and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, replaces the 7-inch unit which was offered on the XUV300. 10.25-inch Digital Drivers Display The XUV 3XO comes with a 10.25-inch digital drivers display which shows all the necessary information that you could ask for. The earlier model used to get analogue dials with a multi-information display. 360-degree Camera The XUV 3XO gets a 360-degree camera which makes parking the sub compact SUV or maneuvering through tight lanes a much easier task. The pre-facelift model only got a reverse parking camera along with parking sensors. Connected Car Tech Features Mahindra has offered its Adrenox connected car tech on the XUV 3XO, which can be used to operate certain features and view vital stats from the owners smartphone device. These features were not offered on the outgoing XUV300. Wireless Phone Charger The XUV 3XO gets a wireless phone charger which helps in making sure that your phone battery remains topped up at all times. In the previous model you just had the USB charging ports to rely on. 7-speaker Harman Kardon Audio System The XUV 3XO features a new 7-speaker audio system with a subwoofer sourced from Harman Kardon. The outgoing model got a 6-speaker audio system featuring 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. The upgraded audio system will surely attract the audiophiles out there. Electronic Parking Brake The XUV 3XO also comes equipped with an electronic parking brake with auto hold. The XUV300 got the old-school manual handbrake. 65 W USB-C Fast Charging The XUV 3XO gets a 65 W USB-C fast charging port thats capable of charging a laptop. The earlier model did not get fast charging, making you wait longer to top up your phone battery. Everything comes at a price! The XUV 3XO is priced from Rs 7.49 lakh to Rs 15.49 lakh (ex-showroom). The top-end variant, considering that it packs all the bells and whistles, is priced at a premium of around Rs 73,000 over the outgoing XUV300. It locks horns with the Hyundai Venue , Tata Nexon , Kia Sonet , and Maruti Suzuki Brezza .

The XUV 3XO secured this accolade for both adult and child occupant protection, underlining Mahindras focus on providing world-class safety features in its vehicles. This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions.

In terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO also performed admirably, earning a total score of 43 out of 49 . While the SUV dropped a few points in the vehicle assessment score, it still received full marks in both the dynamic crash test and the child restraint system (CRS) parameters. The test evaluated the ability of child restraint systems to effectively secure young passengers during high-impact situations. The XUV 3XO accommodated CRS installations with ease, ensuring full protection for child passengers. Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level. The XUV 3XOs impressive safety performance is backed by a comprehensive suite of standard safety features.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection.

The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,032 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

The 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO is now available at a starting price of Rs 7.49 lakh; which surely is mouthwatering. However, we've tested this C-SUV in and out and before you make your buying decision, read below our top 5 positives and top 5 negatives of the XUV 3X0. Also, make sure to become a part of our 91Wheels WhatsApp Group to get the latest automotive news and updates.

Mahindra XUV 3XO - 5 Positives 1) Spacious Cabin & Comfortable Ride Quality The biggest USP of the 3XO is its uber-spacious cabin. The light colour interiors offer a decent space for a family of 5 people. The front seats offer good cushioning while the rear seat design is also sought for long-distance comfort. Three passengers can easily sit abreast at the rear seat. Moreover, there are plenty of storage spaces all around the cabin for convenience. Adding to this is the re-tuned suspension of the XUV 3XO that offers a supple ride quality. Bumps, undulations, and cracks on the road are soaked well by its suspension. Moreover, this highway stability and ride is also confidence-inspiring. 2) Strong Engine Performance & Smooth AT Gearbox Ever since its launch, the XUV300 has been loved by owners and enthusiasts for its strong engine performance. This fact remains unchanged on the new 3XO as well. Available in three engine options, the practicality and power are well shared across its range of variants. Mahindra offers two turbo-petrol engine options and a turbo-diesel engine to choose from. All of these offer a torquey and grunt-rich performance. Additionally, the diesel engine is loved for its fuel-efficient nature and it has proven to be a typical highway cruiser. To improve the engine driving experience, the new 3XO now comes with the option of a 6-speed AISIN-sourced torque converter auto gearbox. It is a very smooth unit that also delivers good fuel economy. Sadly, it is only available on the 1.2L TGDi petrol engine. 3) Strong Build Quality & Top-Notch Safety The overall build quality and fit-finish of the 3XO are superb. There are no panel gaps or inconsistencies in the metal or plastic quality. The fitment of panels and plastic elements like the bumpers is spot-on. Also, the interior quality is no less than a German car. The top-notch material used for leather and stitching with the best threads along with good quality plastic used all around the cabin, give a cumulative feel of a premium car. The outgoing XUV300 was a GNCAP 5-star crash test rating car. It was one of the safest SUVs in India. The newer model has uplifted this game one step above. For the top variants, the XUV 3XO comes equipped with ADAS Level 2 features. These include active front collision warning and autonomous assist features like\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/91W-Featured-Image-1-3.png?w=1920&q=65', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'border-2 border-white ring-2 ring-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-18.18.32-1024x576.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Interior', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120415', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-17.39.17-1024x577.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120404', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'title': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carandbike.com/reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-3-reasons-to-buy-and-3-reasons-to-avoid-3215746', 'content': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 3 Reasons To Buy And 3 Reasons To Avoid English Bangalore Home News & Reviews News Latest News Technology Car News Electric Cars Bike News Comparision Motorsport Upcoming Cars Business News Opinion Reviews Car Reviews First Drive Bike Reviews Comparison Road Test Latest News Kinetic DX Electric Scooter Launch Details Revealed Porsche Cayenne, Cayenne Coupe Black Edition India Prices Revealed Harley-Davidson LiveWire Reveals Two Electric Bike Concepts Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R Recalled Over Engine Issue 2025 TVS Apache RTR 310: Variants Explained Videos Expert Reviews Car Reviews Bike Reviews First Look News & Episodes The car&bike News The car&bike Show In Conversation With Categories Travelogue The car&bike Awards Car Crash Tests Latest Videos KTM 390 Adventure X Review: More Affordable, More Value!

Published On May 08, 2024 07:30:00 AM 43,554 Views Follow us on By Autocar India News Desk Share - Mahindra recently announced prices for the heavily updated XUV300 , which is now christened the Mahindra XUV 3XO . While much is already known about the updated Tata Nexon rival, we take a closer look at the most significant changes in an interview with R Velusamy, president of automotive technology and product development at Mahindra. R Velusamy at the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Mahindra XUV 3XO: styling updates add practicality While the XUV 3XO got a major design overhaul, most of it has been cleverly confined to plastic bits and there arent many sheet metal changes. We have carried over the existing bonnet. Grille, bumper and headlamps are new, said Velusamy. At the back, the tailgate is the major sheet metal change. Boot space has increased by 40 litres. The previous tailgate was not looking attractive. The new-look tailgate has a flatter design with connected tail lamps, which look better. Also, the new tailgate is more vertically positioned; this along with a slightly deeper area in the boot and slight repositioning of the panels [means] there is 40 litres of more boot space. Mahindra has also reprofiled the XUV 3X0s rear bumper to give it a fresher look. Mahindra XUV 3XO now has a lot in common with XUV700 The XUV 3X0 has a lot more tech than the discontinued XUV300 and quite a bit has been carried over from the brands flagship, the XUV700. This not only creates greater economies of scale but also helps the brand avoid niggles later by choosing tried and tested components. The XUV 3X0 gets two infotainment head units; the one used in the AX line-up is from the XUV700 , explained Velusamy. The ADAS modules, the SVS setup with four cameras, and also the CDC (Cockpit domain control) system, except the display, are carried over. More than a few bits, like the infotainment unit, are shared with the XUV700. Additionally, the XUV 3XOs audio system components, including the amplifier, are actually the ones that will feature in the brands upcoming born-electric SUV line-up. Mahindra XUV 3XO powertrains get tweaks; new Aisin auto gearbox The XUV 3XO gets two 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine options, with the lower variants equipped with a non-direct injection motor that churns out 111hp and 200Nm. This engine is mated to a 6-speed manual as standard. The 1.2-litre TGDI petrol engine, which features direct injection, is good for 131hp and up to 250Nm of peak torque. While the 6-speed manual is also standard here, gearbox choices for both turbo-petrol engines include an Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic, which has been updated, too. This gearbox is the Gen 3 version from Aisin, which is more refined. It has better drivability thanthe Gen 2 variant and a higher oscillation, along', 'images': [{'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/20240507063144_First Drive 3XO Web.012.jpeg?w=700&c=1', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO: tech secrets decoded', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO: tech secrets decoded', 'class': 'img-fluid ne-lis-img', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/XUV 3XO x R Velusami.001.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO, R Velusamy', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO, R Velusamy', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/First Drive 3XO Web.015.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO boot', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO boot', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/First Drive 3XO Web.003.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/3XO Engine Collage.001.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO engine', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO engine', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/general-news/10-features-mahindra-xuv-3xo-gets-over-outgoing-xuv300/52944/', 'content': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets These 10 Features Over The XUV300 - ZigWheels 0 NEWS & REVIEWS NEW CARS NEW BIKES SCOOTERS MORE Used Cars Forum Home News 10 Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets Over Outgoing XUV300 Overview Price Variants Mileage Specs Offers Colours Images More 10 Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets Over Outgoing XUV300 Published May 6, 2024 Views : 1985 3 min read By Yashein Kewalramani Follow us The XUV 3XO, with the added features over the previous model, has become a more desirable and attractive SUV Mahindra has launched the XUV 3XO , which is basically a facelifted version of the XUV300. With this facelift, it gets an upgraded cabin with plenty of new features which make the SUV more premium, increasing its value proposition. In this report, we are going to take you through 10 features that the XUV 3XO packs over its predecessor. Panoramic Sunroof The XUV 3XO features a panoramic sunroof for its higher-end variants, a first for its segment. It is a feature which is usually offered on cars that are of a segment above. And fret not, lower-end variants also gets a sunroof, but a smaller single-pane unit. Level-2 ADAS The XUV 3XO comes equipped with Level-2 ADAS, making it the first in its segment to get this feature. Its rivals like the Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue get Level-1 ADAS with less features. The previous model did not get any driver aids. 10.25-inch Touchscreen Infotainment System The XUV 3XO gets a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which is borrowed from the XUV400 EV. This new infotainment system, which packs connected car tech and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, replaces the 7-inch unit which was offered on the XUV300. 10.25-inch Digital Drivers Display The XUV 3XO comes with a 10.25-inch digital drivers display which shows all the necessary information that you could ask for. The earlier model used to get analogue dials with a multi-information display. 360-degree Camera The XUV 3XO gets a 360-degree camera which makes parking the sub compact SUV or maneuvering through tight lanes a much easier task. The pre-facelift model only got a reverse parking camera along with parking sensors. Connected Car Tech Features Mahindra has offered its Adrenox connected car tech on the XUV 3XO, which can be used to operate certain features and view vital stats from the owners smartphone device. These features were not offered on the outgoing XUV300. Wireless Phone Charger The XUV 3XO gets a wireless phone charger which helps in making sure that your phone battery remains topped up at all times. In the previous model you just had the USB charging ports to rely on. 7-speaker Harman Kardon Audio System The XUV 3XO features a new 7-speaker audio system with a subwoofer sourced from Harman Kardon. The outgoing model got a 6-speaker audio system featuring 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. The upgraded audio system will surely attract the audiophiles out there. Electronic Parking Brake The XUV 3XO also comes equipped with an electronic parking brake with auto hold. The XUV300 got the old-school manual handbrake. 65 W USB-C Fast Charging The XUV 3XO gets a 65 W USB-C fast charging port thats capable of charging a laptop. The earlier model did not get fast charging, making you wait longer to top up your phone battery. Everything comes at a price! The XUV 3XO is priced from Rs 7.49 lakh to Rs 15.49 lakh (ex-showroom). The top-end variant, considering that it packs all the bells and whistles, is priced at a premium of around Rs 73,000 over the outgoing XUV300. It locks horns with the Hyundai Venue , Tata Nexon , Kia Sonet , and Maruti Suzuki Brezza .

The XUV 3XO secured this accolade for both adult and child occupant protection, underlining Mahindras focus on providing world-class safety features in its vehicles. This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions.

In terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO also performed admirably, earning a total score of 43 out of 49 . While the SUV dropped a few points in the vehicle assessment score, it still received full marks in both the dynamic crash test and the child restraint system (CRS) parameters. The test evaluated the ability of child restraint systems to effectively secure young passengers during high-impact situations. The XUV 3XO accommodated CRS installations with ease, ensuring full protection for child passengers. Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level. The XUV 3XOs impressive safety performance is backed by a comprehensive suite of standard safety features.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection.

The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,032 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

The 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO is now available at a starting price of Rs 7.49 lakh; which surely is mouthwatering. However, we've tested this C-SUV in and out and before you make your buying decision, read below our top 5 positives and top 5 negatives of the XUV 3X0. Also, make sure to become a part of our 91Wheels WhatsApp Group to get the latest automotive news and updates.

Mahindra XUV 3XO - 5 Positives 1) Spacious Cabin & Comfortable Ride Quality The biggest USP of the 3XO is its uber-spacious cabin. The light colour interiors offer a decent space for a family of 5 people. The front seats offer good cushioning while the rear seat design is also sought for long-distance comfort. Three passengers can easily sit abreast at the rear seat. Moreover, there are plenty of storage spaces all around the cabin for convenience. Adding to this is the re-tuned suspension of the XUV 3XO that offers a supple ride quality. Bumps, undulations, and cracks on the road are soaked well by its suspension. Moreover, this highway stability and ride is also confidence-inspiring. 2) Strong Engine Performance & Smooth AT Gearbox Ever since its launch, the XUV300 has been loved by owners and enthusiasts for its strong engine performance. This fact remains unchanged on the new 3XO as well. Available in three engine options, the practicality and power are well shared across its range of variants. Mahindra offers two turbo-petrol engine options and a turbo-diesel engine to choose from. All of these offer a torquey and grunt-rich performance. Additionally, the diesel engine is loved for its fuel-efficient nature and it has proven to be a typical highway cruiser. To improve the engine driving experience, the new 3XO now comes with the option of a 6-speed AISIN-sourced torque converter auto gearbox. It is a very smooth unit that also delivers good fuel economy. Sadly, it is only available on the 1.2L TGDi petrol engine. 3) Strong Build Quality & Top-Notch Safety The overall build quality and fit-finish of the 3XO are superb. There are no panel gaps or inconsistencies in the metal or plastic quality. The fitment of panels and plastic elements like the bumpers is spot-on. Also, the interior quality is no less than a German car. The top-notch material used for leather and stitching with the best threads along with good quality plastic used all around the cabin, give a cumulative feel of a premium car. The outgoing XUV300 was a GNCAP 5-star crash test rating car. It was one of the safest SUVs in India. The newer model has uplifted this game one step above. For the top variants, the XUV 3XO comes equipped with ADAS Level 2 features. These include active front collision warning and autonomous assist features like\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/91W-Featured-Image-1-3.png?w=1920&q=65', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO 5 Pros & 5 Cons To Know Before Buying', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'border-2 border-white ring-2 ring-gray-300', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-18.18.32-1024x576.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Interior', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120415', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-29-at-17.39.17-1024x577.jpeg?width=640&&q=80', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'width': '900', 'height': '600', 'class': 'wp-image-120404', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3X0', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.91wheels.com/images/imgBackground.png?w=360&q=60', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'title': 'Mahindra Scorpio N', 'width': '265', 'height': '176', 'class': 'aspect-[3/2] lg:w-full fade-in', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.carandbike.com/reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-3-reasons-to-buy-and-3-reasons-to-avoid-3215746', 'content': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: 3 Reasons To Buy And 3 Reasons To Avoid English Bangalore Home News & Reviews News Latest News Technology Car News Electric Cars Bike News Comparision Motorsport Upcoming Cars Business News Opinion Reviews Car Reviews First Drive Bike Reviews Comparison Road Test Latest News Kinetic DX Electric Scooter Launch Details Revealed Porsche Cayenne, Cayenne Coupe Black Edition India Prices Revealed Harley-Davidson LiveWire Reveals Two Electric Bike Concepts Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R Recalled Over Engine Issue 2025 TVS Apache RTR 310: Variants Explained Videos Expert Reviews Car Reviews Bike Reviews First Look News & Episodes The car&bike News The car&bike Show In Conversation With Categories Travelogue The car&bike Awards Car Crash Tests Latest Videos KTM 390 Adventure X Review: More Affordable, More Value!

Published On May 08, 2024 07:30:00 AM 43,554 Views Follow us on By Autocar India News Desk Share - Mahindra recently announced prices for the heavily updated XUV300 , which is now christened the Mahindra XUV 3XO . While much is already known about the updated Tata Nexon rival, we take a closer look at the most significant changes in an interview with R Velusamy, president of automotive technology and product development at Mahindra. R Velusamy at the launch of the Mahindra XUV 3XO. Mahindra XUV 3XO: styling updates add practicality While the XUV 3XO got a major design overhaul, most of it has been cleverly confined to plastic bits and there arent many sheet metal changes. We have carried over the existing bonnet. Grille, bumper and headlamps are new, said Velusamy. At the back, the tailgate is the major sheet metal change. Boot space has increased by 40 litres. The previous tailgate was not looking attractive. The new-look tailgate has a flatter design with connected tail lamps, which look better. Also, the new tailgate is more vertically positioned; this along with a slightly deeper area in the boot and slight repositioning of the panels [means] there is 40 litres of more boot space. Mahindra has also reprofiled the XUV 3X0s rear bumper to give it a fresher look. Mahindra XUV 3XO now has a lot in common with XUV700 The XUV 3X0 has a lot more tech than the discontinued XUV300 and quite a bit has been carried over from the brands flagship, the XUV700. This not only creates greater economies of scale but also helps the brand avoid niggles later by choosing tried and tested components. The XUV 3X0 gets two infotainment head units; the one used in the AX line-up is from the XUV700 , explained Velusamy. The ADAS modules, the SVS setup with four cameras, and also the CDC (Cockpit domain control) system, except the display, are carried over. More than a few bits, like the infotainment unit, are shared with the XUV700. Additionally, the XUV 3XOs audio system components, including the amplifier, are actually the ones that will feature in the brands upcoming born-electric SUV line-up. Mahindra XUV 3XO powertrains get tweaks; new Aisin auto gearbox The XUV 3XO gets two 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine options, with the lower variants equipped with a non-direct injection motor that churns out 111hp and 200Nm. This engine is mated to a 6-speed manual as standard. The 1.2-litre TGDI petrol engine, which features direct injection, is good for 131hp and up to 250Nm of peak torque. While the 6-speed manual is also standard here, gearbox choices for both turbo-petrol engines include an Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic, which has been updated, too. This gearbox is the Gen 3 version from Aisin, which is more refined. It has better drivability thanthe Gen 2 variant and a higher oscillation, along', 'images': [{'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/20240507063144_First Drive 3XO Web.012.jpeg?w=700&c=1', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO: tech secrets decoded', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO: tech secrets decoded', 'class': 'img-fluid ne-lis-img', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/XUV 3XO x R Velusami.001.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO, R Velusamy', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO, R Velusamy', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/First Drive 3XO Web.015.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO boot', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO boot', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/First Drive 3XO Web.003.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://img.autocarindia.com/Features/3XO Engine Collage.001.jpeg?w=700&c=0', 'alt_text': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO engine', 'title': 'Mahindra XUV 3XO engine', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/general-news/10-features-mahindra-xuv-3xo-gets-over-outgoing-xuv300/52944/', 'content': '2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets These 10 Features Over The XUV300 - ZigWheels 0 NEWS & REVIEWS NEW CARS NEW BIKES SCOOTERS MORE Used Cars Forum Home News 10 Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets Over Outgoing XUV300 Overview Price Variants Mileage Specs Offers Colours Images More 10 Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Gets Over Outgoing XUV300 Published May 6, 2024 Views : 1985 3 min read By Yashein Kewalramani Follow us The XUV 3XO, with the added features over the previous model, has become a more desirable and attractive SUV Mahindra has launched the XUV 3XO , which is basically a facelifted version of the XUV300. With this facelift, it gets an upgraded cabin with plenty of new features which make the SUV more premium, increasing its value proposition. In this report, we are going to take you through 10 features that the XUV 3XO packs over its predecessor. Panoramic Sunroof The XUV 3XO features a panoramic sunroof for its higher-end variants, a first for its segment. It is a feature which is usually offered on cars that are of a segment above. And fret not, lower-end variants also gets a sunroof, but a smaller single-pane unit. Level-2 ADAS The XUV 3XO comes equipped with Level-2 ADAS, making it the first in its segment to get this feature. Its rivals like the Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue get Level-1 ADAS with less features. The previous model did not get any driver aids. 10.25-inch Touchscreen Infotainment System The XUV 3XO gets a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which is borrowed from the XUV400 EV. This new infotainment system, which packs connected car tech and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, replaces the 7-inch unit which was offered on the XUV300. 10.25-inch Digital Drivers Display The XUV 3XO comes with a 10.25-inch digital drivers display which shows all the necessary information that you could ask for. The earlier model used to get analogue dials with a multi-information display. 360-degree Camera The XUV 3XO gets a 360-degree camera which makes parking the sub compact SUV or maneuvering through tight lanes a much easier task. The pre-facelift model only got a reverse parking camera along with parking sensors. Connected Car Tech Features Mahindra has offered its Adrenox connected car tech on the XUV 3XO, which can be used to operate certain features and view vital stats from the owners smartphone device. These features were not offered on the outgoing XUV300.

In the previous model you just had the USB charging ports to rely on. 7-speaker Harman Kardon Audio System The XUV 3XO features a new 7-speaker audio system with a subwoofer sourced from Harman Kardon. The outgoing model got a 6-speaker audio system featuring 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. The upgraded audio system will surely attract the audiophiles out there. Electronic Parking Brake The XUV 3XO also comes equipped with an electronic parking brake with auto hold. The XUV300 got the old-school manual handbrake. 65 W USB-C Fast Charging The XUV 3XO gets a 65 W USB-C fast charging port thats capable of charging a laptop.

The XUV 3XO secured this accolade for both adult and child occupant protection, underlining Mahindras focus on providing world-class safety features in its vehicles. This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions. However, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings of adequate to marginal due to the impact forces recorded during the collision.

Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level.

The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points .

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Also Read: Toyota Urban Cruiser Taisor First Drive Review - Similar To Fronx, Yet Different! Mahindra XUV 3XO - 5 Positives 1) Spacious Cabin & Comfortable Ride Quality The biggest USP of the 3XO is its uber-spacious cabin. The light colour interiors offer a decent space for a family of 5 people. The front seats offer good cushioning while the rear seat design is also sought for long-distance comfort. Three passengers can easily sit abreast at the rear seat. Moreover, there are plenty of storage spaces all around the cabin for convenience. Adding to this is the re-tuned suspension of the XUV 3XO that offers a supple ride quality. Bumps, undulations, and cracks on the road are soaked well by its suspension. Moreover, this highway stability and ride is also confidence-inspiring. 2) Strong Engine Performance & Smooth AT Gearbox Ever since its launch, the XUV300 has been loved by owners and enthusiasts for its strong engine performance. This fact remains unchanged on the new 3XO as well. Available in three engine options, the practicality and power are well shared across its range of variants. Mahindra offers two turbo-petrol engine options and a turbo-diesel engine to choose from. All of these offer a torquey and grunt-rich performance. Additionally, the diesel engine is loved for its fuel-efficient nature and it has proven to be a typical highway cruiser. To improve the engine driving experience, the new 3XO now comes with the option of a 6-speed AISIN-sourced torque converter auto gearbox. It is a very smooth unit that also delivers good fuel economy. Sadly, it is only available on the 1.2L TGDi petrol engine. 3) Strong Build Quality & Top-Notch Safety The overall build quality and fit-finish of the 3XO are superb. There are no panel gaps or inconsistencies in the metal or plastic quality. The fitment of panels and plastic elements like the bumpers is spot-on. Also, the interior quality is no less than a German car. The top-notch material used for leather and stitching with the best threads along with good quality plastic used all around the cabin, give a cumulative feel of a premium car.
