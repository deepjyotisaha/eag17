            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO aims to be a competitive offering in the compact SUV segment. This report consolidates information from available sources regarding its features, digital capabilities, and safety aspects. It will also address the crucial gap in price and safety data, based on previous search result failures.\n\n**Overview**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO presents a redesigned aesthetic with an athletic stance.  It boasts a ground clearance of 201 mm, making it suitable for varied terrains. Notable exterior features include LED DRLs, headlamps, and infinity tail lamps, along with 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels.\n\n**Trims and Pricing:**\nWhile a full price list is not available due to search failures in previous steps, some sources indicate the ex-showroom price ranges from approximately Rs 7.49 Lakh to Rs 15.49 Lakh. These prices are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. The following trims are mentioned across various sources, but their specifications and exact pricing require verification with a dealership:\n\n*   MX1\n*   MX2\n*   MX2 PRO\n*   MX3\n*   MX3 PRO\n*   AX5\n*   AX5 Luxury\n*   AX7\n*   AX7 Luxury\n\n**Engine Options:**\nThe XUV 3XO provides several engine choices:\n\n*   1.5-liter diesel engine (115 horsepower)\n*   1.2-liter turbo-petrol engine (110 horsepower)\n*   1.2-liter turbo-petrol engine (129 horsepower)\n\nIt is available with both 6-speed manual and automatic transmission options. Performance figures vary, with the mStallion TGDi engine claiming 0-60 km/h acceleration in 4.5 seconds and fuel efficiency of around 20.1 km/l.\n\n**Digital Features:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO incorporates several smart connectivity and technology features. Notable inclusions are:\n\n*   Harman Kardon 7-speaker audio system\n*   High-definition touchscreen infotainment system\n*   Built-in Amazon Alexa integration\n*   ADRENOX Connect technology for remote car control\n*   Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay\n* Depending on the variant, there are 26.03 cm infotainment screens.\n\nThe infotainment system offers customizable widgets, layouts, and media integration. Navigation functionalities include real-time traffic updates, connected navigation, 3D maps, and offline maps (MX3 variant onward).\n\n**Safety Features:**\nUnfortunately, a dedicated search for safety features yielded no results. However, some sources mention standard safety equipment across all models, including six airbags, rear disc brakes, and electronic stability control. The top models are equipped with Level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), encompassing features such as:\n\n*   Forward collision warning\n*   Hill-start assistance\n*   Blind spot monitoring\n*   Electronic parking brake with auto-hold\n*   360-degree camera\n\n*It is crucial to independently verify the exact safety features and their availability for each trim with an authorized Mahindra dealer.*\n\n**Interior Features**\nThe XUV 3XO features skyroof and soft-touch leatherette on the door trims and dashboard, and also premium leatherette seats. Features cooled glovebox, passive keyless entry, a front armrest with storage and a console with a cup holder.\n\n**Missing Information & Risks:**\nThis report is incomplete due to the lack of reliable price and safety information. The absence of confirmed pricing makes cost comparisons challenging.  More significantly, incomplete safety data creates a serious risk of users making ill-informed decisions about vehicle safety.  *Potential buyers should consult Mahindra dealerships for definitive specifications and pricing details.*  Relying solely on the data in this report is not advisable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO appears to be a feature-rich compact SUV with a focus on digital integration and comfort. The lack of verified safety information and detailed pricing, however, is a significant drawback. Prospective buyers are advised to seek comprehensive information from official Mahindra sources before making a purchase decision.",
