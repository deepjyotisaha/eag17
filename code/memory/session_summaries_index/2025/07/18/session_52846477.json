This beast by Mahindra has gained attention for its advanced features and design, which are further complemented with its safety features. It is an upgraded version of the Mahindra XUV300 that packs a strong punch. The starting price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is Rs. 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom), making it an affordable yet well-equipped compact SUV. The safety of a vehicle is best measured through crash test ratings, and Mahindra has ensured that the XUV 3XO meets high standards. The Mahindra XUV 3XO safety rating proves that it is one of the safest cars in its segment. Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP Safety Rating Checking a cars NCAP rating is one of the best ways to understand how safe it is.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO received a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP, meaning it provides excellent protection for both adults and children. Lets look at the details of the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP rating. Mahindra XUV 3XO Adult Occupant Protection Rating During the adult occupants rating in the NCAP test, the Mahindra XUV 3XO NCAP ratings were pretty impressive. The vehicle scored the maximum possible score of 29.36 out of 32 points . Some crucial factors that contributed to this high rating include: Stable Bodyshell: The structure of the Mahindra XUV 3XO has been found to be stable, meaning it can withstand additional impact without collapsing. Frontal Impact Protection: The cars front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners helped reduce injuries to the head, neck, and chest. Side Impact Protection: The side structure of the XUV 3XO, along with additional side and curtain airbags, ensured safety in side collisions. Electronic Stability Control (ESC): This system helps maintain control of the car during sudden turns or slippery conditions, reducing the chances of rollovers.
