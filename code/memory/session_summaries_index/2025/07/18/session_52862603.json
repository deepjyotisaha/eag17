The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax.

Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,047 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?
