View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

While the dual colours elevate the cabins appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you wont be left with a sweaty back on a hot day.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.

View showroom Find a deal The light SUV segment is one of the most competitive in the Australian market. It was once the domain of the Japanese and Korean manufacturers, but in recent years the Chinese have brought better and more advanced compact SUVs to market for under $30,000 drive-away. Within a short few months, Australias affordable, light-size, city-friendly SUV sector will gain another new member, this time from India in the form of the all-new Mahindra XUV 3XO . The name might be a mouthful, but the offering is serious, and it takes on the likes of the Chery Tiggo 4 , Hyundai Venue , Kia Stonic , Mazda CX-3 , Toyota Yaris Cross , Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross . In this segment Australian buyers are extremely price- and feature-conscious, which has seen the likes of the Tiggo 4 excel, while buyers preferring traditional brands at a more premium price have the option of household names like the Yaris Cross and Juke. Needless to say, Mahindra enters a very competitive market with its new XUV 3X0, but if it can get the price and the positioning right, its fourth model line in Australia brings the biggest opportunity yet for the Indian brand to increase its local sales volume. Ahead of its Australia launch in the coming weeks, and to determine if the Mahindra XUV 3XO is any good, we visited the companys test track located about two hours from Chennai in India. First things first, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent and scale of the brands research and development centre. Mahindra has what can only be described as a world-class facility at its disposal to not only develop cars but to also thoroughly test them. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is already on sale in the Indian domestic market, where it has been met with extreme demand, but vehicles headed to Australia are still undergoing final preparations including tuning. Unlike Chinese manufacturers, which bring media to their facilities and then put limits on how we can drive the vehicles in terms of speed and testing, the Indians basically handed us the keys at a high-speed test track and said have fun. Hence we tested numerous XUV 3XO vehicles at speeds in excess of 175km/h on banked turns, and we put the cars through a series of slalom tests and performed high-speed direction changes and other extreme tests that no buyer would ever put their car through. First impressions? If Mahindra can get the price right, XUV 3XO is going to be an extremely competitive offering in the Australian market. But lets take a deeper look. How much does the Mahindra XUV 3XO co\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/josh-nevett-authors-cm3xxxs4v00006i2o2hapflqz-1.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Josh Nevett profile picture', 'class': '_1ivmml5c7 _1ivmml513 _1ivmml55et _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml51jr', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/466/310/cms/v1/media/2025-07-audi-s5-avanthero-3x2-1.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Audi S5 Avant review', 'class': 'gbfidvr _1ivmml516 _1ivmml5zz _1ivmml5dj _1ivmml51jr _1ivmml5x _1ivmml5dj', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://images.carexpert.com.au/resize/200/-/cms/v1/media/2025-07-2025-mahindra-xuv-3xo-4.jpg', 'alt_text': '2025 Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7L review', 'class': 'wbf64x4 wbf64x4 _1d27tql0', 'confidence': 0.7999999999999999}], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.team-bhp.com/news/2024-mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-8-pros-7-cons', 'content': \"2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons | Team-BHP Skip to main content About Us | Advertise | Contact Us Forum Hot Threads News Reviews Photos Buy Used Car Spare Parts Buy Accessories Classifieds Store News 2024 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review : 8 Pros & 7 Cons 8th May 2024, 12:20 by Omkar Shendge View Forum Discussion It gets a refreshed exterior, some changes to the interiors, quite a few feature additions and a new 6-speed Aisin-sourced automatic gearbox for its petrol engines. Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Updated on Nov 14, 2024 11:31:17 AM 54,083 Views Follow us on Spacious rear seat with plenty of head, knee and shoulder room. Fabric seats more suited to our conditions as they're easier to maintain and the material is more breathable than leatherette. Fog lamps are missing in this version. By Saumil Shah Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Value for money Engine performance and refinement Ride comfort We Don't Like Small boot The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. Whats missing is a variant badge on the boot.

It doesnt get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions.

Lets dive into the newly launched Mahindra XUV 3XO, a vehicle packed with features that make it a top contender in its segment. Whether youre searching for great engine performance or unbeatable in-car tech, this SUV has something for everyone. Panoramic Sunroof and Elegant Interiors Who doesnt love a sunroof? The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts the largest panoramic sunroof in its segment, offering a breathtaking view on those long drives. The interior options give a touch of sophistication, with leatherette upholstery available on top trims. If you're aiming for practicality, the lower variants come with durable fabric options, ensuring you find the right balance between luxury and utility. Engine Performance to Suit Your Drive Style This SUV offers two engine choices to fit different needs: 1.2L Petrol Engine: Producing 110 PS and 200 Nm of torque, ideal for smooth city rides. 1.5L CRDI Diesel Engine: Delivering 116 PS and 300 Nm of torque, ensuring effortless highway drives. If you need power combined with efficiency, the diesel variant promises impressive torque delivery, making it ideal for road trips. Advanced Safety Features and Ratings Safety is non-negotiable, and the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers on that front. Right from the base model, you get all four disc brakes, six airbags, and a five-star safety rating - one of the highest in its class. It also includes power windows across all four doors as standard, ensuring convenience. Variants and Value-for-Money Choices The Mahindra XUV 3XO comes in several exciting variants, including the MX series and the AX series . If youre on a budget but still want the essentials, the A5 variant is a great pick. It offers: Manual transmission at 12.3 lakhs (on-road). Automatic transmission at 14 lakhs (on-road). The top-end AX7 trim is loaded with premium features like 360 cameras, electronic parking brakes, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System), which enhance both safety and convenience. In-Car Technology and Infotainment For tech lovers, this SUV doesnt disappoint. It comes with Harman Kardon sound systems, offering immersive audio, but only on select high-end models. Other highlights include: Wireless charging from the MX3 Pro variant onwards. Dual-zone automatic climate control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, with an intuitive touchscreen infotainment system. Built-in navigation system with a high-resolution display. Driving Comfort and Space Even if you are on the taller side, the Mahindra XUV 3XO offers ample headroom and legroom. Rear passengers benefit from additional AC vents, Type-C ports, and a 12V charging socket. Plus, the center armrest with twin cup holders adds a touch of convenience on family road trips. The boot space of 364 liters is sufficient for your weekend luggage, and the hydraulic tailgate makes it easy to load and unload items. While the powered tailgate feature is missing, the ease of manual operation ensures a hassle-free experience. Fuel Efficiency You Can Count On Mahindra claims a fuel efficiency of around 20 km/l for the petrol variant under ideal conditions. However, in real-world city driving, expect around 12-14 km/l with the manual transmission. For diesel enthusiasts, the Mahindra XUV 3XO delivers 15-16 km/l in urban settings and up to 20 km/l on highways. Financing and Insurance Options When it comes to financing your purchase, Mahindra offers attractive loan options through partner banks.
