Show header, siderbar and make it in dark theme. (HTML/JS/CSS). This is an expensive project, so need as many design elements as possible. Can CoderAgent atleast 10 times, everytime adding one interesting feature. In the demo chat, show atleast 10-15 interactions. Show chart in the chatwindow. Chat window should be scrollable. There should be a chat history shown on the left sidebar (which should be collapsable). Show dropdown to change the LLM Model as well. Also don't use random names for things, use realisting examples for chat names, etc.. Make it look as if designed professionally for a VC pitch.. show off!!",
