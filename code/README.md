You are a stock researcher, prepare a very very detailed and comprehensive report on Asian Paints. You must include graphs, tables, comparisons. Finally you must share a well formatted and polished HTML report. You get extra money for making the report very comprehensive and visually appealing! (use Report Generator Agent directly to generate charts, tables and HTML report). Hint: For graphs, and tables, you must first collect relevant data sources (revenue trend, market share etc.) and then use Coder Agent to generate the graphs
